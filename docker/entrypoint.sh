# Starts as root, reads the bind-mounted Docker socket's group so the
# unprivileged `floci` user can reach it on any host, then re-executes this
# script as `floci` via coreutils `chroot --userspec`, which also grants that
# group as a supplementary group. The second invocation falls through to exec
# the user's command. No gosu, no usermod: both would cost a package layer the
# base image does not otherwise need.
#
# Why: on native Linux Docker, /var/run/docker.sock is owned by
# root:docker with mode 660 and the docker GID varies by distro. On
# Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) the socket is typically root:root (GID
# 0). Without the group fix-up below, floci (uid 1001, group 0) can open
# the socket on Docker Desktop but not on native Linux — which breaks
# ECR, Lambda, and RDS service emulation there. Discovering the GID at
# runtime handles every host transparently.
