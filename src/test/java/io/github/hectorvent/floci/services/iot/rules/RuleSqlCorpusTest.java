/**
 * Real statements, mostly lifted from the AWS IoT SQL reference, sorted into the two things the
 * parser may do with them. A statement inside the subset must parse. A statement outside it
 * must fail naming the first thing that could not be placed, never anything else, because
 * that failure is what sends the rule down the unparsed path and into the WARN log. The
 * tokenizer runs before the parser, so a character outside the grammar (an arithmetic sign,
 * an unquoted slash) is named ahead of any token the parser would have stumbled on.
 *
 * <p>When a construct is implemented, move its rows from the second test to the first.
