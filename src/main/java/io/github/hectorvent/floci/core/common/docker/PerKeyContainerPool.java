/**
 * Lazily starts, health-checks, and reuses one container per arbitrary key. Pulled out of
 * {@code VerdaccioSidecarManager} (one Verdaccio container per CodeArtifact npm repository) since
 * that lifecycle logic (map of running containers, per-key start lock so concurrent first-use of
 * two different keys never blocks on each other, health poll, restart-on-unhealthy, stop-all on
 * shutdown) has nothing Verdaccio-specific in it; only how to actually build and start a container
 * for a given key does. A future per-repository sidecar (pypiserver, BaGet) can reuse this
 * directly instead of re-deriving the same map/lock/poll skeleton.
 *
 * <p>Callers own the health-check path and the actual container creation (image, config, env),
 * supplied per call since those are exactly the format-specific parts.
