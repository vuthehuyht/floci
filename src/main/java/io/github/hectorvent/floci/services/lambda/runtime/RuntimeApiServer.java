/**
 * Per-container HTTP server implementing the AWS Lambda Runtime API and, for
 * Lambda Extensions (e.g. aws-lambda-web-adapter), the Extensions API.
 * NOT a CDI bean — instances are created by RuntimeApiServerFactory.
 *
 * The container's language runtime connects to this server to:
 * - Poll for the next invocation (GET /runtime/invocation/next)
 * - Report success (POST /runtime/invocation/{requestId}/response)
 * - Report failure (POST /runtime/invocation/{requestId}/error)
 *
 * Extension processes (binaries under /opt/extensions/) connect to this server to:
 * - Register for lifecycle events (POST /extension/register)
 * - Poll for the next event (GET /extension/event/next)
 * - Report an init/exit error (POST /extension/init/error, /extension/exit/error)
 *
 * Extension event delivery is intentionally decoupled from invoke completion: unlike real
 * AWS (where the Invoke phase only ends once the runtime AND every registered extension have
 * each signaled done via /next), completing a PendingInvocation's resultFuture here depends
 * only on the runtime's own /response or /error call. Extensions are still notified of every
 * INVOKE/SHUTDOWN via their own /event/next polling loop. This is a deliberate simplification:
 * it's enough for extensions like aws-lambda-web-adapter (whose registration alone is what
 * gates it starting its proxy loop) without taking on exact post-invoke completion timing,
 * which mainly matters for extensions doing work after the response is already returned to
 * the client (e.g. flushing telemetry) — not a fidelity floci's local dev/test use case needs.
 *
 * Locking discipline: every read/write of {@code stopped}, {@code pendingQueue},
 * {@code waitingContexts}, {@code extensions}, and each {@code RegisteredExtension}'s
 * {@code pendingEvents}/waiting context happens inside a single {@code synchronized(lock)}
 * block per operation. That block only *decides* what to do (dispatch to a specific
 * RoutingContext, complete a future, or nothing) and returns/collects that decision — the
 * actual {@code ctx.response()...end()}/{@code vertx.runOnContext(...)} calls always happen
 * after releasing the lock, so the lock is never held across a call into Vert.x and hold
 * times stay to sub-microsecond in-memory queue operations. One lock per server instance
 * (up to ~100 instances live at once, one per container) means no cross-container contention.
 * This intentionally stays non-blocking/event-loop-based throughout — NEXT_PATH and
 * EXTENSION_NEXT_PATH never park a real thread in {@code wait()} — because the container's
 * language-runtime bootstrap process holds one of these long-polls open for its entire idle
 * lifetime; blocking a bounded worker-thread pool (Quarkus's default is 20 threads) for that
 * long would exhaust it with only a handful of warm containers.
