## Why some ports don't need docker-compose mapping

There are two distinct patterns Floci uses to expose container ports:

### Proxy-in-Floci (ElastiCache, MemoryDB, RDS, Neptune, MWAA)

Floci runs a **proxy process inside its own container**. The proxy listens on the host port and forwards traffic to the backend container.

```
host:6379  →  [docker-compose ports mapping]  →  Floci container:6379  →  Redis container:6379
```

Because the listener is inside the Floci container, `ports:` in `docker-compose.yml` is required to make it reachable from the host.

### Direct container binding (ECR, EKS, OpenSearch, Amazon MQ)

Floci tells the Docker daemon to start a sidecar/service container and bind its port **directly on the host**. Floci itself communicates with the container via the shared Docker network (container name + internal port). The host port is bound by Docker, not by Floci.

```
host:9400  ←──  opensearch container:9200  (Docker binds 9400 directly on the host)
                        ↑
       Floci reaches it via Docker network: floci-opensearch-{name}:9200
```

No `docker-compose.yml` `ports:` mapping is needed — the port is already on the host.

## Port 4566 — AWS API

Every AWS SDK and CLI call goes to port `4566`. This includes all management-plane operations: creating queues, putting items, invoking Lambdas, etc.

```bash
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
aws sqs list-queues --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
aws lambda list-functions --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

## Ports 6379–6399 — ElastiCache

When you create an ElastiCache replication group, Floci starts a Valkey/Redis Docker container and creates a TCP proxy on the next available port in the `6379–6399` range. The proxy runs inside the Floci container, so this range must be mapped in `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
# Create a replication group
aws elasticache create-replication-group \
  --replication-group-id my-redis \
  --replication-group-description "dev cache" \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566

# Connect directly on the proxied port (returned in DescribeReplicationGroups Endpoint.Port)
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379
```

!!! note
    Configure the range with `FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_PROXY_BASE_PORT` and `FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_PROXY_MAX_PORT`.

## Ports 6500–6599 — EKS (real mode)

When you create an EKS cluster in real mode, Floci asks the Docker daemon to start a k3s container and bind its API server port (6443) to the next available host port in `6500–6599`. The port is bound directly on the host by Docker — no `docker-compose.yml` mapping is needed.

The `endpoint` field returned by `DescribeCluster` points to `https://localhost:<hostPort>` when running outside a container, or `https://floci-eks-<name>:6443` when Floci is running inside Docker.

```bash
aws eks create-cluster \
  --name my-cluster \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/eks-role \
  --resources-vpc-config subnetIds=[],securityGroupIds=[] \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566

# DescribeCluster returns the API server address, e.g. https://localhost:6500
```

!!! note
    Configure the range with `FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_API_SERVER_BASE_PORT` and `FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_API_SERVER_MAX_PORT`.

## Ports 7001–7099 — RDS

When you create an RDS DB instance, Floci starts a PostgreSQL or MySQL Docker container and creates a TCP proxy on the next available port in the `7001–7099` range. The proxy runs inside the Floci container, so this range must be mapped in `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier mydb \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --master-username admin \
  --master-user-password secret \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566

# Connect using the proxied port (returned in DescribeDBInstances Endpoint.Port)
psql -h localhost -p 7001 -U admin
```

!!! note
    Configure the range with `FLOCI_SERVICES_RDS_PROXY_BASE_PORT` and `FLOCI_SERVICES_RDS_PROXY_MAX_PORT`.

## Ports 12000–12499 — Lambda Runtime API (internal)

Floci binds a Runtime API port in `12000–12499` for each warm Lambda container to poll. These ports are consumed by containers on the shared Docker network only — they are never accessed from the host and must **not** be mapped in `docker-compose.yml`.

One port is held for the lifetime of each running Lambda container, so the width of this range is a hard ceiling on **concurrent Lambda executions** — 500 with the default. This range was previously `9200–9299`; if you pinned that in your own configuration, raise it.

Configure the range with `FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API_BASE_PORT` and `FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API_MAX_PORT`.

## Ports 9400–9499 — OpenSearch (real mode)

When you create an OpenSearch domain in real mode, Floci asks the Docker daemon to start an `opensearchproject/opensearch` container and bind its REST port (9200) to the next available host port in `9400–9499`. The port is bound directly on the host by Docker — no `docker-compose.yml` mapping is needed.

The `endpoint` field returned by `DescribeDomain` points to `http://localhost:<hostPort>` when running outside a container, or `http://floci-opensearch-<name>:9200` when Floci is running inside Docker.

```bash
aws opensearch create-domain \
  --domain-name my-search \
  --engine-version OpenSearch_2.11 \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566

# DescribeDomain returns the data-plane address, e.g. http://localhost:9400
curl http://localhost:9400/_cluster/health
```

!!! note
    Configure the range with `FLOCI_SERVICES_OPENSEARCH_PROXY_BASE_PORT` and `FLOCI_SERVICES_OPENSEARCH_PROXY_MAX_PORT`.

## Ports 5672–5699 and 15672–15699: Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ, real mode)

When you create an Amazon MQ broker in real mode, Floci starts a `rabbitmq:3-management` container and binds its AMQP port (5672) to the next available host port in `5672–5699`, and its management console (15672) to the next available host port in `15672–15699`. Both are bound directly on the host by Docker, in every topology. No `docker-compose.yml` mapping is needed, and adding one on the `floci` service would only conflict with the broker container's binding.

The `BrokerInstances[].Endpoints` returned by `DescribeBroker` point to `amqp://localhost:<hostPort>` when Floci runs outside a container, or to the broker container's Docker-network IP when Floci runs inside Docker. In the second case, host clients should use the published host port instead (`docker ps` shows it); the first broker normally lands on `5672` / `15672`.

```bash
aws mq create-broker --broker-name my-broker --engine-type RABBITMQ \
  --engine-version "3.13" --deployment-mode SINGLE_INSTANCE \
  --host-instance-type mq.t3.micro --no-publicly-accessible --auto-minor-version-upgrade \
  --users '[{"Username":"admin","Password":"AdminPass123","ConsoleAccess":true}]' \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566

# From the host, once the broker is RUNNING:
#   amqp://admin:AdminPass123@localhost:5672/
#   http://localhost:15672  (management console)
```

!!! note
    Configure the ranges with `FLOCI_SERVICES_AMAZONMQ_AMQP_HOST_PORT_BASE` / `_MAX` and `FLOCI_SERVICES_AMAZONMQ_CONSOLE_HOST_PORT_BASE` / `_MAX`.

## Ports 5100–5199 — ECR Registry

ECR is backed by a separate `registry:2` sidecar container (`floci-ecr-registry`) that Floci starts on the first ECR API call. That container binds its port directly on the host — **do not** add `5100-5199` to the floci service's `ports` in Docker Compose. Doing so pre-allocates those ports on the Floci container and prevents the sidecar from binding them.

```
host:5100  ←──  floci-ecr-registry (registry:2 container, started by Floci)
```

`docker login localhost:5100` works because the sidecar has a direct host port binding.

!!! warning "Do not expose ECR port range on the floci service"
    Adding `- "5100-5199:5100-5199"` to the floci service ports will conflict with the ECR sidecar and break `docker push` / `docker pull`.

## Exposing Ports in Docker Compose

Only the proxy-based services (ElastiCache, MemoryDB, RDS, Neptune, MWAA) need port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`. Direct-binding services (ECR, EKS, OpenSearch, Amazon MQ) bind their ports on the host automatically via Docker:

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    ports:
      - "4566:4566"           # All AWS API calls
      - "6379-6399:6379-6399" # ElastiCache / Redis proxy (proxy in Floci)
      - "6400-6419:6400-6419" # MemoryDB proxy (proxy in Floci)
      - "7001-7099:7001-7099" # RDS proxy (proxy in Floci)
      - "8182-8282:8182-8282" # Neptune Gremlin proxy (proxy in Floci)
      - "8700-8799:8700-8799" # MWAA webserver proxy (proxy in Floci)
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

EKS (6500–6599), OpenSearch (9400–9499) and Amazon MQ (5672–5699, 15672–15699) ports are bound directly on the host by Docker and are accessible without any `ports:` entry. ECR (5100–5199) must not be added.

If your application runs inside the same Docker Compose network, it can reach Floci directly on container port `4566` — the host port mapping is only needed for tools running on the host (CLI, IDE plugins, etc.).
