# Amazon Macie

Floci implements the REST JSON organization surfaces used to configure Macie locally.

## Supported Actions

| Action | Description |

| `ListMembers` | - |

<!-- floci:actions:end -->

Delegation is visible in both the management-account and delegated-account request scopes. Designating the delegated administrator enables Macie for that account in the Region, matching AWS Organizations integration behavior.

`GetMacieSession` returns `ResourceNotFoundException` before Macie is enabled. Enabling an already enabled session or attempting incompatible administrator state returns `ConflictException`. Request validation and missing-resource behavior use the modeled `ValidationException` and `ResourceNotFoundException` responses.

AWS also models provider-side `InternalServerException`, `ServiceQuotaExceededException`, and `ThrottlingException`; these are not injected artificially.

See the [Amazon Macie API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
