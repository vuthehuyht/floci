# Redshift

**Protocol:** Query (XML) for the management API
**Management Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:4566/` with `Action=` param
**Data Endpoint:** Floci's auth proxy on the `Endpoint` and `Port` returned by `DescribeClusters` (PostgreSQL wire protocol)

Floci emulates Amazon Redshift by managing a real [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Docker container per cluster behind a Redshift-shaped control plane. Each cluster sits behind a lightweight auth proxy on the Floci host, so the endpoint is reachable from outside Docker and the master password is validated at the proxy, a `ModifyCluster` password change takes effect for new connections immediately. Redshift speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so the cluster endpoint returned by `DescribeClusters` works with any standard PostgreSQL driver (`psql`, JDBC, `psycopg`, …).

> **Always read the host and port from `DescribeClusters`** rather than assuming a fixed port. PostgreSQL listens on `5432` *inside* the container; the port you connect to is dynamically assigned on the host and returned as `Clusters[0].Endpoint.Port`. Redshift's conventional port is `5439`, but the emulator does not bind it: use whatever `DescribeClusters` reports.

The container has **no persistent volume**: if the physical container survives a Floci restart it is adopted and its data is kept, but if the container itself is gone (host reboot, `docker rm`, a pruned dev box) the cluster comes back empty. Use `CreateClusterSnapshot` / `RestoreFromClusterSnapshot` to preserve data explicitly.

For running SQL without a PostgreSQL wire connection (the way Lambda and Step Functions do), see the [Redshift Data API](redshift-data.md).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable Redshift |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_IMAGE_VERSION` | `postgres:15-alpine` | PostgreSQL Docker image backing each cluster |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_DEFAULT_PORT` | `5439` | Reported Redshift port hint (the real host port is dynamic and comes from `DescribeClusters`) |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_PROXY_BASE_PORT` | `7100` | Lowest host port the per-cluster auth proxies bind |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_PROXY_MAX_PORT` | `7199` | Highest host port the per-cluster auth proxies bind |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT_HOST` | _(unset)_ | Hostname advertised in `DescribeClusters`; unset resolves from the Docker host |

Redshift needs the Docker socket so it can launch PostgreSQL containers. Each cluster's container is published on a dynamically assigned host port, returned by `DescribeClusters`.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  floci:

# Read host and port from DescribeClusters: the host port is dynamic.
host, port = "localhost", 32768  # e.g. Clusters[0].Endpoint.Address / .Port
with psycopg.connect(f"host={host} port={port} dbname=dev user=admin password=Secret123") as conn:
    conn.execute("CREATE TABLE people (name text)")
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO people VALUES ('Alice')")
    for row in conn.execute("SELECT * FROM people"):
        print(row)
```

### Management API (Python / boto3)

```python
import boto3

redshift = boto3.client(
    "redshift",
    endpoint_url="http://localhost:4566",
    region_name="us-east-1",
)

cluster = redshift.create_cluster(
    ClusterIdentifier="my-warehouse",
    NodeType="dc2.large",
    MasterUsername="admin",
    MasterUserPassword="Secret123",
)
print(cluster["Cluster"]["Endpoint"])
```

## SQL Interceptor

Floci's Redshift auth proxy inspects frontend queries on the PostgreSQL wire protocol and rewrites common Redshift-specific table DDL so it runs on the plain PostgreSQL backend.

### DDL compatibility

- Redshift-only table DDL keywords are stripped before the statement is forwarded: `DISTSTYLE ALL|EVEN|KEY|AUTO`, `DISTKEY (<col>)` and column-level `DISTKEY`, `[COMPOUND|INTERLEAVED] SORTKEY (<cols>)` and column-level `SORTKEY`, and `ENCODE <codec>` for the real Redshift column encodings (`raw`, `az64`, `bytedict`, `delta`, `delta32k`, `lzo`, `mostly8`, `mostly16`, `mostly32`, `runlength`, `text255`, `text32k`, `zstd`) or `auto`.
- The rewrite only runs when the statement's first keyword is `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE`. A `SELECT`, `INSERT`, function body, or string literal that merely contains one of these keywords is forwarded byte-for-byte. Single-quoted and dollar-quoted string literals are masked before the rewrite, so a keyword inside a quoted value (including in a later statement of a multi-statement query) is preserved.
- Columns legitimately named `distkey`, `sortkey`, or `encode` survive.

### COPY from S3

`COPY <table> [(<columns>)] FROM 's3://<bucket>/<keyOrPrefix>' [options]` sent over the Simple
Query protocol is emulated: Floci reads the object (or every object under the prefix, in key
order) through its own S3 service and streams the rows into the backing PostgreSQL container with
`COPY ... FROM STDIN`.

- Supported options: `DELIMITER`, `FORMAT CSV` (or a bare `CSV`), `GZIP`, `IGNOREHEADER <n>` and
  `HEADER`, `NULL AS`, and an explicit column list.
- The default framing is pipe-delimited text, matching Redshift. `FORMAT CSV` switches to CSV with
  a comma default delimiter.
- `IGNOREHEADER` and `HEADER` skip lines from the first resolved object only.
- `GZIP` is the only input compression recognized; `BZIP2`, `LZOP` and `ZSTD` are not.
- S3 access is authorized as an unsigned request: with `FLOCI_SERVICES_S3_ENFORCE_AUTH` off it is
  unrestricted; with it on, bucket policy and public access settings apply.
- Any other clause (`FIXEDWIDTH`, `JSON`, `PARQUET`, `AVRO`, `ORC`, `MANIFEST`, `MAXERROR`,
  `DATEFORMAT`, `TIMEFORMAT`, `REGION`, `ENCODING`, `ESCAPE`, `REMOVEQUOTES`, `BLANKSASNULL`,
  `EMPTYASNULL`, `TRUNCATECOLUMNS`, `ACCEPTINVCHARS`, credentials clauses, and so on) is not
  recognized: the statement is forwarded unchanged and PostgreSQL returns its own error.
- A multi-statement query whose COPY is followed by another statement is not intercepted; send the
  COPY on its own.
- Extended Query COPY is supported when the complete statement is present in `Parse` and has no
  bind parameters. Zero-parameter JDBC `PreparedStatement` calls therefore work with pgjdbc's
  default extended mode. Statements containing bind parameters are forwarded unchanged.

### Limitations

- DDL rewriting works in both Simple Query (`'Q'`) and Extended Query (`Parse`) flows. COPY and
  UNLOAD interception in Extended Query is limited to zero-parameter statements fully present in
  `Parse`; parameterized statements fail open to PostgreSQL.
- The rewrite is textual (regex-based). It masks single-quoted string literals first, so `DEFAULT` / `CHECK` string values are safe, but it is **not** comment-aware and does not recognize escape strings (`E'...'`): an apostrophe inside a `--` or `/* */` comment can make the rewrite skip a Redshift clause. That fails safe: the statement then reaches PostgreSQL, which returns its own syntax error, but avoid apostrophes-in-comments in `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE`.
- A `rewrite` failure or any statement the interceptor does not recognize is forwarded unmodified (fail-open); PostgreSQL then rejects the Redshift-only syntax itself.
- Simple Query ('Q') messages larger than 16 MiB bypass the interceptor and stream through verbatim without heap buffering; non-query traffic also streams through with no size limit.
- `GetClusterCredentials` / `GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM` mint a short-lived password held in memory (lost on restart). As in AWS, `GetClusterCredentials` prefixes the returned `DbUser` with `IAM:` when `AutoCreate` is false and `IAMA:` when it is true; that prefixed name is what the auth proxy and Data API accept. The returned `DbUser` is nominal: the session runs as the cluster master, not a distinct PostgreSQL role, so `current_user`, `GRANT`, and object ownership are the master's.

### UNLOAD to S3

`UNLOAD ('<select-statement>') TO 's3://<bucket>/<prefix>' [options]` runs the select on the
backing PostgreSQL container and writes
the result to S3 as one or more objects under `<prefix>`.

- Framing defaults to pipe-delimited text; `FORMAT CSV` (or `CSV`) switches to CSV
  with a `,` default. `DELIMITER`, `HEADER`, `NULL AS`, and `ADDQUOTES` are honoured
  (`ADDQUOTES` and `HEADER` force CSV framing on PostgreSQL 15).
- `PARALLEL ON` (default) names objects `<prefix>0000_part_00`,
  `<prefix>0001_part_00`, and so on; `PARALLEL OFF` names them `<prefix>000`,
  `<prefix>001`, and so on. The emulator has a single backend node, so more than one
  object appears only when the result exceeds the per-file size. When `HEADER` is
  set, the header row is repeated at the top of every object.
- `MAXFILESIZE [AS] <n> [MB|GB]` sets the per-file size; a bare number is bytes.
  Each file is buffered in memory, so the default is 6 MiB (real Redshift defaults
  to 6.2 GB) and a whole UNLOAD result is capped at 256 MiB; a larger result fails
  with a SQL error (54000). A `MAXFILESIZE` above that 256 MiB cap is not
  intercepted at all: the statement is forwarded and PostgreSQL reports its own error.
- A zero-row result still writes one object (empty, or the header row alone when
  `HEADER` is set).
- `GZIP` compresses each object and appends `.gz` to its key.
- `MANIFEST` writes `<prefix>manifest` listing every object with its
  `content_length`.
- Without `ALLOWOVERWRITE`, a non-empty target prefix fails with SQL error XX000 and the select
  does not run. A failed UNLOAD then removes any objects it had already written. With
  `ALLOWOVERWRITE` a failed UNLOAD leaves its objects in place (they may have replaced prior data,
  so they are not deleted); a `MANIFEST` request that fails this way can leave data objects without
  a manifest, and rerunning the same statement overwrites them.
- S3 access is authorized as an unsigned request, like COPY from S3.
- Any other option (`PARQUET`, `ENCRYPTED`, `REGION`, `IAM_ROLE` / `CREDENTIALS`,
  `ZSTD`, `EXTENSION`, `CLEANPATH`, `PARTITION`, and so on) is not intercepted; the
  statement is forwarded and PostgreSQL reports its own error.
- Extended Query UNLOAD is supported when the complete statement is present in `Parse` and has no
  bind parameters. Parameterized statements are forwarded unchanged.

## Out of Scope

- Real Redshift SQL semantics: the data plane is stock PostgreSQL. Redshift-only table DDL keywords (DISTSTYLE / DISTKEY / SORTKEY / ENCODE) are stripped so CREATE TABLE / ALTER TABLE executes (see [SQL Interceptor](#sql-interceptor)), but the distribution/sort behavior they request is not; SUPER/SPECTRUM are not emulated.
- Multi-node clusters: `NodeType` and `NumberOfNodes` are stored as metadata; every cluster is a single PostgreSQL container.
- Parameter groups apply no real engine settings; values are stored and echoed back only.
- Subnet groups, VPC routing, and security groups are metadata only.
- Resize, pause/resume, IAM authentication, snapshot schedules, and cross-region snapshot copy.
- The auth proxy validates the master user's password and any live `GetClusterCredentials` credential. Other non-master users pass straight through to PostgreSQL, which remains the authority for their credentials.
- IAM database authentication over the wire, and `sslmode=verify-full` against the self-signed proxy certificate.
