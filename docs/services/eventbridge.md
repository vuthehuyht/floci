## Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Create a custom event bus
aws events create-event-bus \
  --name my-bus \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Create a rule matching a pattern
aws events put-rule \
  --name order-placed-rule \
  --event-bus-name my-bus \
  --event-pattern '{"source":["com.myapp"],"detail-type":["OrderPlaced"]}' \
  --state ENABLED \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Add a Lambda target
aws events put-targets \
  --rule order-placed-rule \
  --event-bus-name my-bus \
  --targets '[{
    "Id": "process-order",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:000000000000:function:process-order"
  }]' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Publish an event
aws events put-events \
  --entries '[{
    "Source": "com.myapp",
    "DetailType": "OrderPlaced",
    "Detail": "{\"orderId\":\"123\",\"amount\":99.99}",
    "EventBusName": "my-bus"
  }]' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

## Default Event Bus

EventBridge includes a default event bus (`default`) that accepts events from AWS services. Custom buses are for your own application events.

```bash
# List rules on the default bus
aws events list-rules --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Send to default bus
aws events put-events \
  --entries '[{"Source":"myapp","DetailType":"test","Detail":"{}"}]' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

## Event Bus Targets

A rule can target another event bus by ARN: the event is republished there, and that bus's own rules evaluate it and fan out normally. `Source`, `DetailType`, `Resources` and the originating `account`/`region` carry over, and each hop gets a new event id.

```bash
aws events put-targets \
  --rule order-placed-rule \
  --event-bus-name my-bus \
  --targets '[{
    "Id": "forward-to-domain-bus",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:events:us-east-1:000000000000:event-bus/domain-bus"
  }]' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

## Step Functions Targets

A matching rule can start an unqualified Step Functions state machine ARN. The target supports the
full event as the default input, plus `Input`, `InputPath`, and `InputTransformer`. Floci resolves
the state machine from the account and region in its ARN.

State machine aliases and versions are not supported as EventBridge targets.

## Current Behavior

- `PutEvents` reports success once the source bus accepts an event, so target delivery failures surface only as a `WARN` in the Floci logs.
- A `Detail` forwarded to an event bus must be a JSON object, as in AWS; anything else is dropped, including an `InputPath` selecting a scalar such as `$.detail.orderId` or an envelope carrying `"detail": null`.
- A bus ARN naming another account is forwarded under that account, so the target bus and its rules resolve there.
- Onward delivery from that bus follows each target type: SQS and Step Functions resolve cross-account, while Lambda, SNS, Batch and Firehose resolve in the caller's account.
- An event is forwarded between buses only once, matching AWS: a bus that received an event from another bus does not forward it on to a third. The second hop is dropped with only a `WARN` rather than reported to the caller.
