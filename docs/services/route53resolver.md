# Route 53 Resolver

## Supported Actions

<!-- floci:actions:start -->
| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ListFirewallDomainLists` | Lists all DNS Firewall domain lists, including the four AWS-managed lists computed per region. |
| `GetFirewallDomainList` | Returns a single DNS Firewall domain list by id, whether AWS-managed or custom. |
| `CreateFirewallDomainList` | Creates a custom DNS Firewall domain list with a random-suffix `rslvr-fdl-` id. |
| `DeleteFirewallDomainList` | Deletes a custom DNS Firewall domain list; AWS-managed lists cannot be deleted. |
| `CreateResolverEndpoint` | Creates an inbound (`rslvr-in-`) or outbound (`rslvr-out-`) resolver endpoint, returned immediately as `OPERATIONAL`. |
| `DeleteResolverEndpoint` | Deletes a resolver endpoint and returns its final description. |
| `GetResolverEndpoint` | Returns a resolver endpoint by id. |
| `ListResolverEndpoints` | Lists all resolver endpoints. |
| `UpdateResolverEndpoint` | Updates a resolver endpoint's `Name` and `ResolverEndpointType`; `IpAddresses` changes are not modelled. |
| `CreateResolverRule` | Creates a resolver rule, returned immediately as `COMPLETE`; `ResolverEndpointId` is not validated against an existing endpoint. |
| `DeleteResolverRule` | Deletes a resolver rule and returns its final description. |
| `GetResolverRule` | Returns a resolver rule by id. |
| `ListResolverRules` | Lists all resolver rules. |
| `UpdateResolverRule` | Updates a resolver rule's mutable configuration. |
| `AssociateResolverRule` | Associates a resolver rule with a VPC, returned immediately as `COMPLETE`. |
| `DisassociateResolverRule` | Removes the association between a resolver rule and a VPC. |
| `GetResolverRuleAssociation` | Returns a resolver rule association by id. |
| `ListResolverRuleAssociations` | Lists all resolver rule associations. |

## Design notes

The four AWS-managed DNS Firewall domain lists (`AWSManagedDomainsAggregateThreatList`
and friends) are computed on every call from a fixed name list, with ids derived
deterministically from region+name (SHA-256 based) rather than stored — LZA's
`Custom::ResolverManagedDomainList` Lambda resolves a managed list's Id by Name and
needs it present and stable without any create call. This logic predates the rest of
this service and is untouched.

Everything else (custom firewall domain lists, resolver endpoints, resolver rules,
rule associations) is backed by real per-service storage, added this session. Ids use
the project's standard random-suffix convention (`rslvr-fdl-...`, `rslvr-in-...` /
`rslvr-out-...`, `rslvr-rr-...`, `rslvr-rrassoc-...`), distinct from the deterministic
managed-list ids. Resolver endpoint ids are direction-aware as in AWS: `rslvr-in-` for
`INBOUND` (and `INBOUND_DELEGATION`), `rslvr-out-` for `OUTBOUND`. Any other `Direction`
is rejected with `InvalidParameterException`.

Parameter rejections use the error code the operation actually models, which differs by
family: the resolver endpoint, rule and association operations model the singular
`InvalidParameterException`, while the DNS Firewall operations model `ValidationException`
and do not list `InvalidParameterException` at all.

`CreateFirewallDomainList`, `CreateResolverEndpoint` and `CreateResolverRule` are
idempotent on `CreatorRequestId`, as they are in real AWS: replaying a token returns the
resource it originally created instead of allocating a second one. The check runs after
the request's own validation, so a replayed token never excuses a malformed body. A
request without a `CreatorRequestId` opts out and always allocates a new resource.
Idempotency is scoped per account and per region, matching this regional service: the same
token replayed in another region creates that region's own resource rather than handing
back the first region's.

A token replayed with *different* parameters is a conflict, not a retry:
`CreateResolverEndpoint` and `CreateResolverRule` compare the retry against the stored
resource and raise `ResourceExistsException`, which both operations model.
`CreateFirewallDomainList` is the deliberate exception — it models no conflict error at
all, so a mismatched retry still returns the original list rather than an invented error
code. See `issues/route53resolver-firewall-domain-list-retry-conflict.md`.

For `CreateResolverEndpoint` the comparison covers the actual `IpAddresses` entries,
not just how many there are, so a retry that keeps the count but changes a subnet or
address is a conflict. The member is `IpAddresses`, as AWS names it; its list shape is
`IpAddressesRequest` and each element is an `IpAddressRequest`, which is the name earlier
builds of this service mistook for the wire name.
That spelling is still accepted so existing callers keep working, but it is not the
documented one, and a retry that switches between the two is not a conflict because the
comparison is on contents. Order is not significant. The modelled `ResolverEndpoint` shape has
`IpAddressCount` and no IP list, so the addresses are recorded in a side store rather than
on the resource and never reach the response. If that record is ever missing for a stored
endpoint, the retry is reported as a conflict rather than compared on count alone — with
nothing to compare against, sameness cannot be established, and a loud error is preferable
to a success that may not match the request.

## Limitations

- **All create/update operations complete synchronously.** Real AWS transitions a
  resolver endpoint through `CREATING`, a resolver rule through its own provisioning
  states, before reaching a terminal status. This emulator returns the terminal state
  (`OPERATIONAL` for endpoints, `COMPLETE` for rules and associations) immediately —
  matching the "validate-and-echo" convention used elsewhere in this codebase (see
  `ServiceCatalogService.copyProduct`, `CS-021`).
- **`UpdateResolverEndpoint` only applies `Name` and `ResolverEndpointType`.** Real AWS
  additionally allows updating `IpAddresses` (adding/removing resolver IPs); that is not
  modelled.
- **`CreateResolverRule`/`UpdateResolverRule` do not validate `ResolverEndpointId`
  against an existing endpoint.** Any non-blank string is accepted.
- **No VPC-scoping or region-scoping is enforced for custom resources.** The four
  stores go through `StorageFactory`, so every key is prefixed with the calling
  credential's account id and custom resources *are* isolated per account: one account
  cannot read, update or delete another's endpoints, rules, associations or domain
  lists. Neither region nor VPC is part of the key, though, so a custom resource created
  in one region is visible from every other, and `VPCId` on an association is stored but
  never used to filter. The AWS-managed domain lists are the deliberate exception: they
  are derived per region from the name list rather than stored, so they are region-scoped
  and visible to every caller, as they are in AWS.
