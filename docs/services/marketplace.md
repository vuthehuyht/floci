## Marketplace Catalog

Catalog change sets use AWS states (`PREPARING`, `APPLYING`, `SUCCEEDED`, and `CANCELLED`). Floci applies supported entity mutations locally when a change set is observed and persists entities, change sets, tags, resource policies, and assessments through `StorageFactory`, isolated by AWS account.

## Marketplace Agreement

Agreement request acceptance persists the resulting agreement and exposes it through subsequent read and search operations. State is isolated by AWS account through `StorageFactory`.

### Known deviations

- Accepted agreements use a local 365-day duration instead of deriving the end time from requested terms.
- `PartyType` is validated for AWS-compatible values but does not otherwise change which locally stored agreements match.

## Marketplace Entitlement

AWS exposes this service as read-only: `GetEntitlements` is the only public operation. Floci therefore does not add a non-AWS mutation endpoint. Entitlement records are loaded from the shared `StorageFactory` backend (`marketplace-entitlements.json` in persistent mode), so tests and local environments can pre-seed AWS-shaped entitlement state while preserving account isolation.


## Marketplace Deployment

Deployment parameters and idempotency records are persisted through `StorageFactory` and isolated by AWS account.

## Marketplace Reporting

Marketplace Reporting validates buyer dashboard requests and returns account-scoped local embed URLs for supported dashboard identifiers.

### Known deviations

- AWS limits `GetBuyerDashboard` to an AWS Organizations management account or a delegated administrator registered for procurement insights. Floci does not currently enforce that Organizations-role prerequisite.

## Marketplace Metering

Metering records and idempotency state are persisted through `StorageFactory`, isolated by AWS account and region. `RegisterUsage` produces locally signed PS256 JWTs with an emulator-generated RSA key.

## Marketplace Discovery

Marketplace Discovery reads the shared Marketplace Catalog entity backend and exposes listing, offer, purchase-option, facet, filtering, sorting, and pagination behavior across the supported Discovery regions.



## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
