## StackSets compatibility

StackSets support both `SELF_MANAGED` and the Cloud Launchpad `SERVICE_MANAGED` workflow. `ActivateOrganizationsAccess` requires an Organizations management account with all features enabled and enables trusted access for `stacksets.cloudformation.amazonaws.com`. Service-managed organizational-unit deployment targets are resolved from the caller's actual Organizations state rather than converted into synthetic account IDs. Targeting an OU includes eligible accounts directly in that OU and in all descendant OUs, while excluding the organization management account, matching AWS StackSets targeting semantics.

`CreateStackInstances` and `UpdateStackSet` execute the backing CloudFormation stacks in each target account. A failed resource can therefore drive the backing stack through rollback and leave the stack instance `INOPERABLE` with detailed status `FAILED`; the StackSet operation is reported as `FAILED` instead of being forced to success.

Operation IDs are recorded and validated. Duplicate IDs return `OperationIdAlreadyExistsException`, missing stack sets return `StackSetNotFoundException`, and missing operation IDs return `OperationNotFoundException`. Invalid targets and request shapes use the CloudFormation query-protocol validation errors. Operations complete locally, so `OperationInProgressException` is only reachable when local operation state actually overlaps; Floci does not inject concurrency failures solely to exercise an error code.

## Supported Resource Types

Resource types provisioned during `CreateStack` / `UpdateStack` / `DeleteStack`. Each delegates to
the backing service and sets a real physical ID plus the `Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt` attributes used by
cross-resource references.

<!-- floci:cfn-types:end -->

All other resource types are accepted without error and assigned a synthetic physical ID (with an
`arn:aws:stub:::<logicalId>` ARN attribute), so templates with unsupported types still reach
`CREATE_COMPLETE` rather than failing. Nothing is created for such a resource, so each one is
logged at `WARN` and carries a resource status reason saying so, which `DescribeStackEvents`
returns:

```
Resource type AWS::Fake::Thing is not supported by Floci. It was stubbed and nothing was created for it.
```

Set `floci.services.cloudformation.allow-stub-unsupported-resource-types` to `false`
(`FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDFORMATION_ALLOW_STUB_UNSUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES=false`) to fail such a
resource instead: it reaches `CREATE_FAILED` and the stack rolls back. Use it in a pipeline that
must not pass over a resource it never got.

## EventBridge Event Buses

`AWS::Events::EventBus` creates a real custom EventBridge bus. `Name` is required, `Ref` returns
the bus name, and `Fn::GetAtt` supports `Arn` and `Name`. `Description` and `Tags` are applied when
the bus is created. Rules that reference the bus are removed before stack deletion.

The current implementation is limited to custom buses with the `Name`, `Description`, `Tags`, and
`Policy` properties. `EventSourceName`, `KmsKeyIdentifier`, `DeadLetterConfig`, and `LogConfig` are
rejected with `ValidationError` instead of being silently ignored. AWS models a `Name` change as
resource replacement; Floci currently rejects that update until generic replacement handling is
available. `Policy` is applied when the bus is created. Changing `Description`, `Tags`, or `Policy`
during `UpdateStack` is rejected until transactional resource rollback is available; this prevents a
failed stack update from leaving the live bus in the rejected configuration.

## Secrets Manager Target Attachments

`AWS::SecretsManager::SecretTargetAttachment` adds the target's database connection fields to the
referenced secret while preserving credentials and custom fields. `Ref` and `Fn::GetAtt Id` return
the complete secret ARN, only one attachment can own a secret, and deleting the attachment removes
only its managed connection fields.

Supported target types are:

- `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`
- `AWS::RDS::DBCluster`
- `AWS::DocDB::DBInstance`
- `AWS::DocDB::DBCluster`

Redshift clusters, Redshift Serverless namespaces, and DocumentDB Elastic clusters are not supported
because their backing services are not implemented. A `SecretId` change is applied in place rather
than reproducing CloudFormation's replacement event sequence; failed changes restore affected secret
data and attachment ownership.

## Organizations

`AWS::Organizations::Organization` uses the stack's calling account as the management account, so
the rest of the stack's Organizations resources are provisioned into that account's organization.
`Fn::GetAtt Org.RootId` is the usual way to root the OU tree in the same template. `Organization` is
the one type in this section where bare `Ref` does not return the resource's own id: per AWS, `Ref`
returns the management account id, while `Fn::GetAtt Org.Id` returns the organization id.

- `OrganizationalUnit` — `ParentId` is create-only per the registry schema, so an update only
  renames the OU in place; the physical id survives, keeping every `Ref` to it valid.
- `Account` — `ParentIds` accepts a single entry and the account is moved there after creation
  (accounts are always created under the root). Because Floci resolves a 12-digit access key id
  straight to an account, `Ref`/`Fn::GetAtt AccountId` yields an id you can immediately use as a
  caller identity against other services. `State` mirrors `Status`, the parameter AWS is retiring
  it in favour of; Floci does not model the `PENDING_ACTIVATION` or `CLOSED` phases that only
  `State` can express.
- `Policy` — `TargetIds` is reconciled on update: targets the template adds are attached and ones
  it drops are detached. Deleting the resource detaches its remaining targets first, since
  `DeletePolicy` refuses while a policy is still attached.
- `ResourcePolicy` — backed by `PutResourcePolicy`, which is already create-or-update.

`Fn::GetAtt OrganizationalUnit.Path` and `Fn::GetAtt Account.Paths` return the organization path —
`o-<org>/r-<root>/[ou-<ou>/…]<id>/`. An account has one parent and therefore one path, so the
list-typed `Paths` holds a single entry; read it with `Fn::Select` as you would on AWS.

Deleting the stack removes the resources in dependency order and finally the organization itself.
Deleting a resource that is already gone is tolerated.

## Auto Scaling Launch Template Resolution

`AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` resolves its launch template through any of the shapes AWS
accepts, not only by name:

- `LaunchTemplate` with `LaunchTemplateId` **or** `LaunchTemplateName` (plus an optional `Version`).
  The id and name are distinct lookup keys, so an `lt-` id is matched as an id rather than being
  treated as a name.
- A `Ref` to an in-stack `AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate`, whose `Ref` returns the `lt-` id and whose
  `Fn::GetAtt LatestVersionNumber` supplies the version.
- `MixedInstancesPolicy` → `LaunchTemplate` → `LaunchTemplateSpecification`, including
  `Overrides[].InstanceType` and `InstancesDistribution` (`OnDemandBaseCapacity`,
  `OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity`, `SpotAllocationStrategy`). A non-integer where AWS expects
  a number fails the stack rather than being dropped.

## Lambda Stack Updates

`AWS::Lambda::Function` resources are reconciled during `UpdateStack` in the same shape as CloudFormation/CDK deployments:

- A no-op redeploy keeps the existing physical function name and does not call Lambda update APIs, so warm containers can be reused.
- Code and mutable configuration changes update the existing function in place.
- Replacement-only changes such as `FunctionName` or `PackageType` changes create a replacement function and remove the old one.
- S3-backed code stays linked through `S3Bucket` / `S3Key`, so Lambda's reactive S3 sync continues to work for functions created by CloudFormation or CDK.

## RDS Credential Dynamic References

`AWS::RDS::DBInstance` and `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` resolve CloudFormation dynamic
references in `MasterUsername` and `MasterUserPassword` during resource creation:

- `secretsmanager` references support whole secret strings, JSON keys, version stages, and version IDs.
- `ssm` references accept `String` and `StringList` parameters, using either the latest value or an explicit positive version.
- `ssm-secure` references require a `SecureString` parameter and are supported only for `MasterUserPassword`, matching the AWS resource-property allowlist.

Dynamic-reference expansion is currently scoped to these RDS credential properties.

## Account-Aware Provisioning

Resources provisioned by `CreateStack` / `UpdateStack` land in the **caller's account** namespace
(determined from the request's access key — see [Multi-Account Isolation](../configuration/multi-account.md)).
Deleting the stack removes them from that same account.

Stacks, change sets, and **exports are scoped to the caller account**. `ListExports` returns only the
exports created by that account's stacks, and `Fn::ImportValue` resolves against the same account's
export table — so two accounts can each own an export with the same name without colliding, mirroring
how CloudFormation isolates exports per account and region. This is what lets a multi-account LZA
deployment reuse identical export names across its member accounts.

## Template Parameters

Parameters passed to `CreateStack` / `UpdateStack` (and echoed back by `DescribeStacks`) are resolved
before provisioning:

- **`String`, `Number`, `CommaDelimitedList`, and `List<...>`** parameter types are accepted and
  substituted into resource properties via `Ref`.
- **`AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String>`-typed parameters** are resolved at deploy time: the value the
  caller supplies is treated as an SSM parameter *name*, and floci substitutes the current value of
  that SSM parameter into the template. This is the pattern CDK uses to pull bootstrap values (image
  tags, bucket names) from Parameter Store.
- `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<List<String>>` and `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Name` typed parameters are
  **not yet** resolved — they are passed through as their literal input.

The `AWS::SSM::Parameter` **resource** type exposes `Value`, `Type`, `Name`, and `Arn` attributes through
`Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt` so downstream resources can consume a parameter the same stack creates.

## AWS::Include (`Fn::Transform`)

`Fn::Transform` with `Name: AWS::Include` splices the YAML/JSON snippet at `Parameters.Location`
into its enclosing mapping before any other intrinsic resolves, on both `CreateStack`/`UpdateStack`
and the `CreateChangeSet` preview. `Location` must be an `s3://bucket/key` URI: the template
CloudFormation itself receives always carries one, because `aws cloudformation package` rewrites
every local path before a stack ever sees it. A `Location` that is not `s3://` fails the stack with
a `ValidationError` naming it, rather than silently dropping the include. A `Location` that is a
well-formed `s3://` URI but cannot be read (the bucket or key does not exist) fails the stack with
the underlying S3 error naming it, for example `NoSuchKey` at HTTP 404, instead of a
`ValidationError`, since that error is what S3 itself already reports and floci has no more specific
answer to give.

A snippet may not itself use `AWS::Include`; nesting is rejected rather than expanded or looped.
`Location` must be a plain string; a `Ref` or another intrinsic in its place is rejected, naming
the rejected node, rather than resolved.

Two known deviations from AWS:

- The snippet is parsed with floci's CloudFormation-aware YAML parser, so it accepts CloudFormation
  YAML short tags (`!Ref`, `!Sub`, ...) where AWS's own `AWS::Include` documentation says a snippet
  does not.
- AWS's own `Fn::Transform` documentation shows a `Location` written as an intrinsic function (its
  example uses `Ref`) and describes it as accepted; floci does not resolve one and rejects the
  template instead. This deviation comes from reading AWS's documentation, not from a request
  measured against a real account.

`CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND` is not one of them. floci requires no capability for a template that
declares `AWS::Include`, and neither does AWS on the change-set path: a `CreateChangeSet` carrying
an embedded `Fn::Transform`/`AWS::Include` was accepted against a real account with
`CAPABILITY_IAM` alone. The `CreateStack` path was not measured.

`GetTemplateSummary` does not expand the include: it reports `AWS::Include` in the template's
`Transform`/`DeclaredTransforms` and neither fetches nor validates the snippet, matching AWS.
`GetTemplate` accepts `TemplateStage` (`Original`, the default, or `Processed`) and validates it
against that enum, rejecting anything else with a `ValidationError` naming the value, matching AWS.
`Original` returns the template exactly as submitted, `Fn::Transform` node and all. `Processed`
returns the merged and SAM-expanded tree, the same one a `CreateChangeSet` preview diffs against.

floci expands neither `AWS::LanguageExtensions`, nor a third-party macro, nor the top-level
`Transform: {Name: AWS::Include, Parameters: {Location: ...}}` form. A template carrying only one of
those three keeps `Processed` equal to `Original`, byte for byte.

Two triggers break that equality, because `executeTemplate` re-serializes the persisted body when
either one fires: an embedded `Fn::Transform` that merges, and a SAM transform. A SAM transform goes
further, because `SamTransformProcessor` removes the whole `Transform` section unconditionally, so a
macro co-declared beside SAM is absent from `Processed` as well.

Real AWS's answer for these shapes is unmeasured, co-declared with SAM or not. `StagesAvailable`
always lists both stages, matching AWS.

## Conditions

Template `Conditions` are evaluated before provisioning. A resource whose `Condition` evaluates to
**false is skipped** — it is never provisioned, does not appear in `DescribeStackResources`, and its
`Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt` are not required to resolve. This matches CloudFormation and is required for the
condition-heavy templates CDK and LZA emit.

## Custom Resources and the CDK Provider Framework

`AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` and `Custom::*` resources are backed by their `ServiceToken`
Lambda. floci supports two shapes:

- **Direct custom resources** — floci invokes the handler Lambda with the CloudFormation custom-resource
  event and waits for it to `PUT` its `SUCCESS`/`FAILED` result to the response URL. Inline `ZipFile`
  handlers get the `cfn-response` / `cfnresponse` module bundled in (see the Lambda row in
  [Supported Resource Types](#supported-resource-types)), so Solutions-style handlers work unmodified.
- **CDK Provider framework** — when the `ServiceToken` points at a CDK `framework.onEvent` function,
  floci drives the asynchronous provider protocol: `onEvent` starts the work and `framework.isComplete`
  is polled (via Step Functions [`Retry`](step-functions.md)) until it reports done, at which point the
  ResponseURL callback fires. The wait is bounded by an async custom-resource timeout (3 minutes by
  default); a resource that never completes fails the stack rather than hanging.

## Deletion Policies

A resource's [`DeletionPolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html)
attribute is honored on `DeleteStack` and on the rollback of a failed `CreateStack`:

| Value | `DeleteStack` | Rollback of the create that made the resource |
|---|---|---|
| `Delete` (default) | deleted | deleted |
| `Retain` | kept | kept |
| `RetainExceptOnCreate` | kept | deleted |

A kept resource is reported as `DELETE_SKIPPED` in `DescribeStackEvents` and does not fail the
deletion — the stack still reaches `DELETE_COMPLETE` while the resource keeps existing. This also
lets a stack owning a non-empty S3 bucket be deleted, since the bucket is never touched.

Deviations from AWS to be aware of:

- `Snapshot` deletes the resource without taking a snapshot; floci has no snapshot support for the
  types AWS allows it on.
- Every resource defaults to `Delete`. AWS instead defaults `AWS::RDS::DBCluster`, and
  `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` without a `DBClusterIdentifier`, to `Snapshot`.
- Unrecognized values are treated as `Delete`.
- An update that removes a resource from the template does not delete it (or consult its policy);
  only the new template's resources are provisioned. AWS applies `DeletionPolicy` to update-time
  removals as well.
- After `DeleteStack` completes, a retained resource's `DELETE_SKIPPED` record is only visible
  through `DescribeStackEvents` for the deleted stack, not `DescribeStackResources`.
- `UpdateReplacePolicy`, and the `RetainExceptOnCreate` request parameter of `CreateStack` /
  `UpdateStack`, are not implemented.

## StackSets

StackSets deploy a single template into many target accounts and regions:

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# 1. Create the stack set (in the administration account)
aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
  --stack-set-name my-set \
  --template-body file://template.yml \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# 2. Create instances in two target accounts
aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name my-set \
  --accounts 222222222222 333333333333 \
  --regions us-east-1 \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# 3. The resources materialize in each target account's namespace
aws cloudformation list-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name my-set \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

`CreateStackInstances` drives the single-stack engine once per `(account, region)` pair, provisioning
each instance's resources into that target account's namespace — so a queue named `orders` deployed
into accounts `222222222222` and `333333333333` exists independently in each. The stack set, its
instances, and its operation history are recorded in the administration (caller) account.

`DeleteStackInstances` removes instances and their resources, unless `RetainStacks=true`, which
detaches the instances from the stack set but leaves their underlying stacks and resources in place.
A stack set must be empty before `DeleteStackSet`.

A `CreateStackInstances` / `UpdateStackSet` operation reports `FAILED` if any of its instances fails
to deploy (the instance is marked `INOPERABLE`), so polling `DescribeStackSetOperation` reflects real
provisioning outcomes rather than always returning `SUCCEEDED`.

## Lambda + SQS Event Source Mapping

Deploy a Lambda function wired to an SQS queue as a single stack:

```yaml
# template.yml
Resources:
  MyQueue:
    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
    Properties:
      QueueName: my-queue

  MyFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: my-function
      Runtime: nodejs22.x
      Handler: index.handler
      Role: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/lambda-role
      Code:
        ZipFile: |
          exports.handler = async (event) => {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(event));
          };

  MyESM:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping
    Properties:
      FunctionName: !Ref MyFunction
      EventSourceArn: !GetAtt MyQueue.Arn
      Enabled: true
      BatchSize: 10
```

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name my-lambda-sqs-stack \
  --template-body file://template.yml \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

!!! note "Dependency ordering"
    Use `!Ref MyFunction` (not a plain string) for `FunctionName` so CloudFormation
    provisions the function before the event source mapping.
