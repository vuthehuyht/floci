## Asymmetric Encryption

`Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, and `ReEncrypt` apply real RSAES-OAEP for RSA keys (`RSA_2048`, `RSA_3072`, `RSA_4096`) when `EncryptionAlgorithm` is `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1` or `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`. The ciphertext is raw RSA output of the modulus length, for example exactly 256 bytes for `RSA_2048`. A ciphertext produced locally with the public key from `GetPublicKey` decrypts the same way it does on real AWS, which makes the usual envelope pattern work. Only the encrypting side needs the public key. As on real AWS, asymmetric `Decrypt` requires `KeyId`, an `EncryptionContext` is rejected for asymmetric keys, and plaintext larger than the OAEP capacity of the key fails validation.

Symmetric keys keep the emulator's internal ciphertext format, described below, which is not compatible with ciphertexts from real AWS KMS.

## Symmetric Ciphertext Envelope

`Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `ReEncrypt` and `GenerateDataKey` protect `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT` plaintext with
real AES-256-GCM, using a per-key data-encryption key ("backing key") that is generated when the
key is created, or is the material imported into an `Origin=EXTERNAL` key, and is never exposed by
any API. The blob is opaque bytes, base64-encoded in JSON exactly like real AWS KMS, but
internally it is a versioned envelope:

```
offset      size  field
0           4     magic "KMS3" (0x4B 0x4D 0x53 0x33)
4           1     format version (currently 1)
5           2     key id length (big-endian unsigned short)
7           N     key id (UTF-8)
7+N         2     backing key id length (big-endian unsigned short)
9+N         M     backing key id (UTF-8)
9+N+M       12    AES-GCM IV (random, generated per call)
21+N+M      ...   AES-256-GCM ciphertext, followed by the 16-byte GCM tag
```

The key id lets `Decrypt` identify the key from the blob alone, matching AWS KMS, which does not
require `KeyId` on `Decrypt` for symmetric keys. The GCM additional authenticated data (AAD) is
every header byte up to and including the IV, plus the SHA-256 fingerprint of the canonicalized
`EncryptionContext`. Binding the header into the AAD means decrypting with the wrong key, the
wrong backing key version, or the wrong `EncryptionContext`, and any bit flip anywhere in the
blob (header, IV, ciphertext or tag), all fail GCM tag verification the same way and surface as
`InvalidCiphertextException`, never a plaintext.

`RotateKeyOnDemand` mints a new backing key and switches future encryptions to it, but keeps prior
backing keys in the key's state, so ciphertext encrypted before a rotation keeps decrypting after
it, matching real AWS KMS, which also retains prior backing keys.

### Legacy blob formats (read-only)

Two older, unauthenticated formats are still accepted by `Decrypt` for backward compatibility with
ciphertext produced by earlier versions of this emulator, but are never produced by `Encrypt`
anymore:

- `kms:v2:<keyId>:<nonceHex>:<contextFingerprintHex>:<base64(plaintext)>`
- `kms:<keyId>:<base64(plaintext)>`

Neither format used real key material: the payload was the plaintext itself, base64-encoded, so
anyone holding a v1 or v2 blob could read the plaintext directly, and a tampered blob still
"decrypted" to the original value. Any ciphertext already persisted in this shape (for example,
stored in a database from before this fix) keeps decrypting so existing data is not orphaned, but
new calls to `Encrypt` always produce the AES-GCM envelope described above. Keys created before
backing keys existed generate their backing key material lazily the first time they are used for
a cryptographic operation, and persist it from then on.

## Imported Key Material

`CreateKey` accepts `Origin=EXTERNAL`, which creates a key with no key material in state
`PendingImport`. `GetParametersForImport` returns a real RSA public key and an import token;
material wrapped with that public key by a standard client is unwrapped by `ImportKeyMaterial`,
which puts the key in state `Enabled`. Wrapping material against the wrong key, or with a
different algorithm than the one requested, fails with `InvalidCiphertextException` the same way
it does on AWS.

Supported wrapping algorithms depend on the type of imported key material. Floci supports the
following combinations:

| Key material | Supported wrapping algorithm and spec |
| --- | --- |
| Symmetric encryption key (`SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`) | **Wrapping algorithms:** `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`, `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1`<br>**Wrapping key specs:** `RSA_2048`, `RSA_3072`, `RSA_4096` |
| HMAC key (`HMAC_*`) | **Wrapping algorithms:** `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`, `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1`<br>**Wrapping key specs:** `RSA_2048`, `RSA_3072`, `RSA_4096` |
| Asymmetric RSA private key (`RSA_*`) | **Wrapping algorithms:** `RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256`, `RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1`<br>**Wrapping key specs:** `RSA_2048`, `RSA_3072`, `RSA_4096` |

The hybrid `RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_*` algorithms require a 256-bit AES key. `RSAES_PKCS1_V1_5` is
rejected, matching AWS, which stopped supporting it on October 10, 2023.

An import token is scoped to one key and spent by the import that uses it, and a second
`GetParametersForImport` call invalidates the token the previous one returned. Tokens expire 24
hours after they are issued.

`ExpirationModel=KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES` (the default) requires `ValidTo`, which must be in the
future and no more than 365 days out. Once `ValidTo` passes, the material is dropped and the key
returns to `PendingImport`, as does `DeleteImportedKeyMaterial`. Expiry is evaluated when the key
is next read rather than on a timer, which is not observable through the API. Deleting the
material of a key that is already in `PendingDeletion` leaves that state in place.

A `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT` key with `Origin=EXTERNAL` encrypts under the imported material itself: it
is the backing key named in the ciphertext envelope described above, and no other material is
ever generated for the key. Deleting or expiring the material removes that backing key, so
ciphertext produced under it decrypts again only once the same material has been re-imported.

A key in `PendingImport` rejects cryptographic operations, `EnableKey` and `DisableKey` with
`KMSInvalidStateException`. `CancelKeyDeletion` on a key whose material was never imported, or was
deleted or expired while it was pending deletion, returns it to `PendingImport` rather than to a
usable state it could not serve. `DeleteImportedKeyMaterial` on a key that holds no material
succeeds, as it does on AWS. `ImportKeyMaterial` and `DeleteImportedKeyMaterial` return a
`KeyMaterialId`, derived from the key id and the material as AWS derives it. Re-importing
requires the same material the key was first given; different material is rejected with
`IncorrectKeyMaterialException`.

Automatic key rotation is rejected for keys with imported material, matching AWS: KMS does not
own the material and cannot rotate it.

**Deviations:**

- `Origin=EXTERNAL` supports `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, the `HMAC_*` key specs and the `RSA_*` key specs. 
- Other asymmetric key specs are rejected at `CreateKey` with `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- Holding several imported key materials on one symmetric key, which real KMS uses for on-demand
  rotation of imported material, is not emulated. `ImportType=NEW_KEY_MATERIAL` on a key that
  already has key material is rejected with `UnsupportedOperationException`, and
  `ListKeyRotations` is not implemented.

## Grant Support Scope

Grant lifecycle operations (`CreateGrant`, `ListGrants`, `ListRetirableGrants`, `RevokeGrant`, `RetireGrant`) are supported. However, grant lifecycle support **does not** imply grant-based authorization enforcement on cryptographic operations (`Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `Sign`, `Verify`, `GenerateDataKey`, etc.). Grants are stored and queryable but are not evaluated during crypto operations.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_KMS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |

## Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Create a symmetric key
KEY_ID=$(aws kms create-key \
  --description "My encryption key" \
  --query KeyMetadata.KeyId --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

# Create an alias
aws kms create-alias \
  --alias-name alias/my-key \
  --target-key-id $KEY_ID \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Encrypt
CIPHER=$(aws kms encrypt \
  --key-id alias/my-key \
  --plaintext "Hello, World!" \
  --query CiphertextBlob --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

# Decrypt
aws kms decrypt \
  --ciphertext-blob $CIPHER \
  --query Plaintext --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL | base64 --decode

# Generate a data key (envelope encryption)
aws kms generate-data-key \
  --key-id alias/my-key \
  --key-spec AES_256 \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```
`CreateKey` also accepts a reserved creation-time tag key, `floci:override-id`, when tests need a deterministic `KeyId`. Floci uses the tag value as the created key id, strips the reserved tag from stored resource tags, and rejects attempts to add `floci:*` tags later via `TagResource`.
