# Elastic Load Balancing v2

**Protocol:** Query (XML) — `POST http://localhost:4566/` with `Action=` parameter

Floci supports Application Load Balancers (ALB) and Network Load Balancers (NLB) through the ELBv2 management API. The control plane is AWS SDK / CLI / Terraform compatible, and HTTP listeners can forward to registered instance targets using the target's reachable local address.

> Classic (v1) Elastic Load Balancing is a **different API** served from the same endpoint host —
> see [ELB Classic (v1)](elb-classic.md). Requests are routed by their `Version` parameter:
> `2015-12-01` here, `2012-06-01` there.

## Behavior Notes

- Load balancer, target group, listener, rule, and tag state is persisted through Floci storage and rebuilt on service startup.
- Load balancers are created in `active` state.
- HTTP listener sockets are preserved when listener actions change and are restarted only when socket-level settings such as port change.
- Instance targets are resolved through EC2 instance private addresses so local load balancer traffic can reach containers.
- Target health starts in `initial` state with reason `Elb.RegistrationInProgress` and is updated by Floci's health checker when monitoring is active.
- Each `CreateListener` automatically creates an immutable default rule (`priority=default`, `isDefault=true`). This rule cannot be deleted; use `ModifyListener` to change its action.
- Rule priorities are validated for uniqueness. `SetRulePriorities` is atomic: all priority assignments are validated before any change is committed.
- `DeleteTargetGroup` is rejected with `ResourceInUse` while the target group is referenced by any listener or rule.
- `DeleteRule` is rejected with `OperationNotPermitted` for the default rule.
- `DescribeSSLPolicies` returns a pre-seeded list of standard AWS SSL policies (`ELBSecurityPolicy-*`).
- `DescribeAccountLimits` returns standard default limits (e.g., 50 load balancers per region, 100 target groups, etc.).
- `routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled` (default `false`) controls whether the original client Host header is forwarded to targets unchanged, or replaced with the target's `host:port`.
- `RegisterTargets` rejects link-local and cloud instance-metadata addresses (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`, `fd00:ec2::254`) with `InvalidTarget`, and the load balancer and its health checks refuse to connect to them. Loopback and private addresses stay reachable so a load balancer can front a neighbouring container.

## Listener Ports

Listener sockets bind on the Floci host. Expose any listener ports you need in Docker Compose when Floci itself runs in a container, similar to RDS and ElastiCache proxy ports.

### Two load balancers on the same port

In AWS each load balancer has its own DNS name and addresses, so two of them can both listen on
port 80 and never interact: the network picks the load balancer, and a `host-header` rule only picks
a rule inside one listener. Floci serves every load balancer from a single socket per port, so the
Host header has to carry both decisions. A template that puts a public and an internal load balancer
on port 80 is correct for AWS and stays accepted here, but the request has to name the one it wants.

A listener is chosen in this order:

1. The Host header equals a load balancer's own DNS name (`{name}-{id}.elb.localhost.floci.io`).
2. Exactly one listener on the port has a rule whose `host-header` condition matches the Host
   header. This uses the same matching as the rule evaluation that follows, so it is
   case-insensitive, ignores the port, and applies AWS's wildcards: `*` matches 0 or more
   characters and `?` matches exactly 1, which means `*.example.com` claims `test.example.com`
   but not `example.com`. `HostHeaderConfig.RegexValues` is not supported, by rule evaluation or
   by selection, so a load balancer that names itself only through a regex cannot be selected
   this way.
3. Only one listener is on the port, in which case it answers any Host header.

If none of those resolve, and in particular when two load balancers declare the same hostname or
neither declares any, the request answers `502 No listener for host`. Floci logs a warning naming
both load balancers the first time a second one takes a port, because the targets behind them stay
healthy and nothing else reports the collision.

Giving each load balancer a `host-header` rule for the hostname it serves is usually enough, and it
is the same configuration AWS needs. Moving one load balancer to a different listener port also
works, at the cost of a Floci-only difference from the deployed template.
