Log group deletion protection defaults to disabled and is persisted with the log group. When it is
enabled, `DeleteLogGroup` returns `ValidationException` until protection is explicitly disabled
with `PutLogGroupDeletionProtection`.

Three actions are currently simplified:

- **`PutSubscriptionFilter`** stores the filter so that `DescribeSubscriptionFilters`
  returns it, but log events are **not** forwarded to the destination ARN. Lambda,
  Kinesis, and Firehose subscription destinations are not wired up.
- **`GetDataProtectionPolicy`** does not model data-protection policies. It returns
  HTTP 200 with the resolved `logGroupIdentifier` and no `policyDocument` — including for
  a log group that does not exist, where real AWS returns `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- **`FilterLogEvents`** matches `filterPattern` as a plain substring of the message. The full
  filter pattern syntax described below is applied by metric filters.

### Metric filters {#metric-filters}

A metric filter turns newly ingested log events into CloudWatch metric samples. Each matching
event contributes the literal `metricValue`, or its referenced field (`$.latency` in JSON,
`$size` in space-delimited logs), at the **event timestamp**, not ingestion or filter-creation time.
Events ingested before the filter existed are not replayed. Backdated and future event timestamps
remain backdated and future metric timestamps.

A configured `defaultValue` contributes **once per nonmatching event**, including alongside matches
in the same batch or minute. A matching event with a missing or JSON-null metric-value field also
uses the default; a present nonnumeric value is skipped, not replaced by the default. Without a
default, those nonmatches and missing/null values produce no sample. No events means no samples.
Healthy publication is immediate and needs no subsequent ingestion, reads, or timer. For example,
pattern `ERROR`, value 3 and default 7 produce Sum 13 / SampleCount 3 for `ERROR, INFO, ERROR`,
and three quiet nonmatches produce Sum 21 / SampleCount 3. A late match appends its value without
retracting earlier defaults. CloudWatch aggregates these contributions by period; Floci has no
minute-default accumulator or deduplication history.

Ordinary transformation dimensions are all-or-none: a complete configured set is emitted, while
a missing member produces a dimensionless sample, not a partial set. Requested system dimensions
(`@aws.account`, `@aws.region`) are populated on matches using the resolved receiving account and
region, including regular noncentralized Logs ingestion. **Pattern-nonmatch defaults are
dimensionless**, even when system dimensions are requested. These scenarios are supported by the
recorded [live AWS observations](cloudwatch-metric-filters-verification.md).

**Inferred emulator policy, not a live AWS claim:** matching missing/null metric-value fallbacks
retain requested system dimensions. Likewise, an incomplete ordinary dimension set is discarded
as a unit while requested system dimensions are retained. Null ordinary dimension values are
treated as missing; empty strings retain the existing scalar-extraction behavior. These combinations
were not measured by the recorded probes. Floci does not infer centralized source provenance.

**Publication runs off the request thread:** `PutLogEvents` evaluates the group's filters as they
are at that moment, builds one immutable sample per contributing event (canonical account, region,
group, filter, transformation snapshot, event timestamp and a stable internal publication ID) and
hands them to a process-wide queue. One managed worker writes them to the Metrics store, so
ingestion latency does not depend on the Metrics sink and a `PutMetricFilter` or a reset waits for
at most one sample write. The queue holds **100,000 samples**; a batch that does not fit is written
on the request thread under the filter-store monitor instead of being dropped, so accepted samples
are never lost to the bound and only an overfull queue makes the request wait on the sink.
A read issued immediately after `PutLogEvents` may run before the worker has written the sample,
as on AWS; SDK tests should poll. Shutdown drains the queue before storage shuts down.

**Runtime publication failures:** accepted Logs ingestion remains successful if the Metrics sink
reports a failure. Each failed sample keeps its snapshot and publication ID, and retries replace
that same metric-store key, making partial or ambiguous writes safe without deduplicating distinct
identical log events. The existing AWS `PutMetricData` APIs continue appending samples as before.

The same worker retries failed publications at one-second intervals while both Logs and Metrics
services are enabled; idle ticks never create defaults. The retry map holds at most **10,000
samples**, not 10,000 batches. This fixed conservative limit bounds outage memory without
introducing a configuration surface. When full, new failed samples are dropped with an **ERROR**
containing account, region, group, filter and dropped count; already queued samples and their IDs are
preserved. Successful retries and cancellations release capacity. Each filter-owned outage logs
one detailed stack, followed by a stack-free aggregate warning every 60 failed retry ticks.
Recovery, cancellation and reset release that suppression. This is bounded best effort, not
lossless delivery through an indefinite outage. Pending work is in memory only; crash-durable
pending publication is not implemented. Storage failures that a backend only logs rather than
throws are not observable to this retry path; configured storage durability semantics are unchanged.

A filter update or deletion affects new ingestion only: samples already accepted for a batch still
publish under the definition that was current at ingestion, as on AWS, and deleting a filter or
group cancels only its own account/region-scoped failed retries without retracting stored metrics.
Reset pauses publication, waits for the active sample write, discards queued and failed samples,
wipes storage and resumes the same live service. The canonical filter-store monitor serializes
each sample write with update/delete; reset hooks release it before the storage-factory wipe to
avoid lock inversion. Shutdown writes the queued samples, abandons failed retries and stops the
worker (up to five seconds to await executor termination). Storage backends expose synchronous
operations without a cancellation deadline; a stuck backend can delay that drain. Runtime
cancellation is not a crash-recovery guarantee.

Samples are readable with `GetMetricStatistics` and `GetMetricData`, and alarms evaluate normally.

The filter pattern syntax follows the AWS reference:

- Terms: `ERROR ARGUMENTS` (all present), `?ERROR ?ARGUMENTS` (any present), `ERROR -ARGUMENTS`
  (exclusion), `"exact phrase"`. Terms are case-sensitive substrings of the message.
- Regular expressions between percent signs, `%^[hc]at%`, with the operators and escapes AWS
  allows. Parentheses and characters outside ASCII are rejected, as on AWS.
- JSON patterns: `{ $.eventType = "UpdateTrail" && $.code >= 400 }`, with `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`,
  `>`, `>=`, `IS NULL`, `IS TRUE`, `IS FALSE`, `NOT EXISTS`, `&&`, `||`, parentheses, array indexes,
  `[*]` and `.*` wildcards, and `$.['a.b']` for a property with a dot in its name. AWS's wildcard
  quotas apply: one per property selector and three per pattern.
- Space-delimited patterns: `[ip, ..., status_code = 4*, bytes]`, with named fields, `...` for any
  number of fields, conditions on any field, `w1`/`w2` indicators, and `%regex%` values. Text
  between double quotes or square brackets is one field.

`PutMetricFilter` applies the rules AWS applies: the log group must exist, the pattern must parse,
at most two regular expressions per pattern, exactly one transformation whose `metricValue` is a
number or a single-valued field reference, at most three dimensions in total, and 100 metric
filters per log group. Scalar JSON metric-value and dimension references need not be mentioned
in the filter pattern. Wildcard metric-value references such as `$.values[*]` are rejected;
wildcards remain available in the filter pattern itself. Ordinary dimensions are
available only for JSON or space-delimited patterns and cannot be combined with a `defaultValue`;
system-only dimensions can. The shared group regex quota counts up to five **regex-bearing filters**
across metric and subscription filters, independently of the two expressions allowed per pattern.
This shared pool is documentation-backed, not a new live mixed-writer claim. `TestMetricFilter`
reports one-based event numbers. JSON matches have empty public `extractedValues`; space-delimited
matches expose named fields as `$name` and positional fields as `$1`, `$2` and so on.

`fieldSelectionCriteria` selects which batches a filter processes from the system fields
`@aws.account` and `@aws.region`, with `=`, `!=`, `IN`, `NOT IN` and the `AND` and `OR` the API
documents, as in `@aws.account IN ["111111111111"]`. Both fields describe the ingested batch rather
than the individual event, so one evaluation decides the batch. A criterion that does not parse is
rejected when the filter is stored.

`emitSystemFieldDimensions` adds `@aws.account` and `@aws.region` on matching contributions as
described above. They count toward the same combined limit of three dimensions.

`applyOnTransformedLogs` is stored and returned unchanged. Request acceptance was verified on AWS,
including `true` on the tested group without a group-level transformer. Floci does not execute
group-level or account-level log transformations, including stored `TRANSFORMER_POLICY`
configuration. Accepting the flag therefore does not establish transformed-log processing or
full compatibility with an AWS group that has an active transformer.

See [Metric-filter contract verification](cloudwatch-metric-filters-verification.md) for the
scenarios tagged **Verified on Live AWS**, the recorded fixtures and their evidence boundaries.

### Logs Insights {#logs-insights}

`StartQuery` / `GetQueryResults` / `StopQuery` run a **subset** of the Logs Insights
query language. Supported commands:

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| `fields a, b, ...` | Projection. Defaults to `@timestamp, @message`. `display` is an alias |
| `filter <field> = 'v'` | Equality. `!=` and `==` are also accepted; `where` is an alias |
| `sort <field> [asc\|desc]` | `order` is an alias |
| `dedup <field, ...>` | Keeps the first row per unique tuple, applied after sorting |
| `limit N` | The effective cap is the smallest of this value, the `StartQuery` `limit` parameter, and `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDWATCHLOGS_MAX_EVENTS_PER_QUERY` |

Fields may be `@timestamp`, `@message`, `@ingestionTime`, `@ptr`, or a dotted path into
a JSON log message (for example `level` or `params.job_id`). A `@ptr` column is always
included in each result row, appended unless `fields` already names it.

Unsupported syntax never fails the query, so it is worth knowing how each case degrades:

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| An unsupported command (`stats`, `parse`, ...) | Skipped with a warning in the server log. No aggregation happens |
| A `filter` whose operator is not `=`, `!=` or `==` — for example `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `like /ERROR/` or `=~ /ERROR/` | The whole stage is dropped with a warning, so **every** row is returned |
| A `filter` combining conditions with `and` / `or` — for example `filter level = 'ERROR' and status = 200` | Only the leftmost operator is parsed; the rest of the line becomes the compared value, so nothing matches and you get **no** rows. No warning is logged |
| A projected field that does not exist | Rendered as an empty string. No warning |
| A `sort` direction other than `asc` / `desc` | Treated as ascending. No warning |

In short, a query can come back either wider or narrower than intended without any error. When a
result set looks wrong, check the server log for `Ignoring unsupported Logs Insights ...` — and note
that the compound-filter case above produces no log line at all.

For simple substring matching, `FilterLogEvents` is the more predictable option today. Note that
Floci matches `--filter-pattern` as a plain substring of the message; the real filter-pattern
syntax (`?ERROR ?WARN`, `{ $.level = "ERROR" }`, and so on) is not parsed.

### Reading events past the limit

`FilterLogEvents` and `GetLogEvents` both page, and they signal the end of the results differently
because the AWS APIs do.

`FilterLogEvents` pages forward only. Its `nextToken` is an `f/<index>` offset into the matched set,
so the offset counts matches, not stored events: a request narrowed by `--filter-pattern`,
`--start-time` or `--log-stream-names` pages through only what it matched. A missing token starts
from the oldest match, and **a response with no `nextToken` means pagination is finished**, so the
final page omits it. An unrecognized, non-numeric or negative token returns
`InvalidParameterException` (400). `startFromHead` is not supported, so results always run oldest
first.

`GetLogEvents` pages in both directions with `f/<index>` and `b/<index>`, and always returns
`nextForwardToken` and `nextBackwardToken`. It signals the end by returning the same token it was
given rather than by omitting it, which is what its SDK paginators expect.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDWATCHLOGS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the CloudWatch Logs service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDWATCHLOGS_MAX_EVENTS_PER_QUERY` | `10000` | Maximum events returned per `FilterLogEvents` / `GetLogEvents` call, and the upper bound for a Logs Insights `limit` |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDWATCHLOGS_QUERY_COMPLETION_DELAY_MS` | `0` | Artificial Logs Insights query delay. With `0` a query completes immediately. A positive value emulates the real asynchronous lifecycle (`Running` → `Complete` after the delay), which also makes `StopQuery` on a still-running query return `success=true` |

### Storage

Log groups, streams, filters and resource policies follow the configured storage mode as every
other service does. The event store is the one CloudWatch Logs store under steady append load, so
under `persistent` mode it is journaled instead of rewritten on every `PutLogEvents` call: a
batch is appended to `cwlogs-events.wal`, and `cwlogs-events.json` is rewritten from memory on
the `FLOCI_STORAGE_WAL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL_MS` cadence and at shutdown. The store keeps at most
20,000 events per account (`FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDWATCHLOGS_MAX_STORED_EVENTS`), which bounds both
the memory footprint and the size of each snapshot. `hybrid` remains the alternative when a
bounded delay for every CloudWatch Logs store is acceptable. See
[Storage Modes](../configuration/storage.md#journaled-stores-under-persistent-mode).
