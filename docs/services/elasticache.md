# ElastiCache

**Protocol:** Query (XML) for management API + Redis RESP protocol for data plane
**Management Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:4566/`
**Data Endpoint:** `localhost:<proxy-port>` (TCP)

Floci manages real Valkey/Redis Docker containers and proxies TCP connections to them. This means any Redis client works — including IAM authentication.

### Single-node Redis/Valkey clusters

`CreateCacheCluster` serves three engines. `Engine=memcached` starts a Memcached container and
reports its node-discovery `ConfigurationEndpoint`. `Engine=redis` or `Engine=valkey` starts a
single-node cluster with no replication group: the same Valkey container and auth proxy a
cluster-mode-disabled replication group gets, on a port from the same proxy range, which defaults
to 6379. AWS allows only one node in that shape, so `NumCacheNodes` greater than 1 is refused with
`InvalidParameterValue`, as it is on a live account.

This is the call `aws_elasticache_cluster` with `engine = "redis"` emits, which is why it is not
interchangeable with `CreateReplicationGroup`: a single-node cluster created this way never appears
in `DescribeReplicationGroups`. Following AWS, it carries no `ConfigurationEndpoint` either, and
reports its node's address under `CacheNodes` when the request sets `ShowCacheNodeInfo`. These
clusters are re-provisioned after a Floci restart, the same as replication groups and Memcached
clusters.

An id is taken across all three at once: a standalone cache cluster, a Memcached cluster and a
replication group cannot share one. Two of them would have `DescribeCacheClusters` report the same
id twice, and for a cache cluster against a replication group it is worse, since Floci names both
their containers `valkey-<id>` and keys both their proxies by it. Whichever create arrives second
is refused, whether it is `CreateCacheCluster` or `CreateReplicationGroup`, rather than allowed to
remove the first's container.

`CacheSubnetGroupName` must name a subnet group that exists, as on AWS, on the `Engine=redis` and
`Engine=valkey` paths. `Engine=memcached` drops the parameter: it is neither checked nor echoed
back. (`CreateReplicationGroup` does not check it either, so a replication group can still be
created against a name nothing resolves.)

Each record re-reserves its proxy port as it is restored, before Floci serves anything, so a
create is never handed a port a surviving cluster or replication group still advertises.

`SnapshotRetentionLimit`, `SnapshotWindow`, `PreferredMaintenanceWindow`,
`PreferredAvailabilityZone`, `SecurityGroupIds`, `NetworkType`, `IpDiscovery` and
`AtRestEncryptionEnabled` (output-only on real AWS's CreateCacheCluster; accepted here leniently and echoed) are kept and echoed by `DescribeCacheClusters`, with the same defaults
and the same validation the replication group applies, since every one is an optional
`aws_elasticache_cluster` argument that would otherwise read back unset and leave a permanent
plan diff. `NotificationConfiguration` and `LogDeliveryConfigurations` are **not** modelled: a
request may send them, and the describe will not report them back.

### Cluster Mode

`CreateReplicationGroup` provisions a real sharded Valkey cluster when the request asks for one:
`NumNodeGroups` greater than 1, a `default.*.cluster.on` parameter group, a custom parameter group
with `cluster-enabled` set to `yes`, or `ClusterMode=enabled`.

Floci starts one `--cluster-enabled` container per node — `NumNodeGroups × (1 + ReplicasPerNodeGroup)`
in total — forms the cluster (config epochs, MEET, slot assignment, replica attachment), and fronts
each node with its own auth-proxy port from the proxy port range. Nodes announce Floci's configured
hostname as their preferred endpoint (`cluster-announce-hostname` with
`cluster-preferred-endpoint-type hostname`, plus `cluster-announce-client-ipv4`/
`cluster-announce-port`), so `CLUSTER SLOTS`, `CLUSTER SHARDS` and `MOVED`/`ASK` redirects hand
clients the same name the `ConfigurationEndpoint` reports, while the cluster bus keeps using the
container network. Any cluster-aware Redis/Valkey client works against the reported
`ConfigurationEndpoint`.

Because clients must resolve the announced name to follow redirects, a `FLOCI_HOSTNAME` that only
resolves inside Floci's Docker network (such as the Compose service name `floci`) breaks
cluster-aware clients connecting from outside it. Set
`FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_CLUSTER_ANNOUNCE_HOSTNAME` to a universally resolvable name in that
case — the shipped `docker-compose.yml` uses `localhost.floci.io`, which public DNS resolves to
`127.0.0.1` on the host (reaching the published proxy ports) while the Compose network alias and
Floci's embedded DNS resolve it to the Floci container from inside Docker. Cluster-mode groups
then announce that name and report it as their `ConfigurationEndpoint`.

With `persistent`, `hybrid` or `wal` storage, every replication group, standalone cache cluster
and Memcached cluster is re-provisioned from its persisted record on startup: containers are restarted, cluster-mode groups
are re-formed, and proxy ports are re-reserved. Caches restart empty, as on any Floci restart:
only the topology is persisted, never the keyspace.

Ports are re-reserved and records marked `creating` before Floci reports ready; the container
restarts and cluster formation run in the background so a slow Docker daemon cannot delay
readiness, and each record flips to `available` once its data plane is back. A replication group
whose data plane cannot be brought back is reported with status `create-failed` instead of
`available`, and its member clusters answer `DescribeCacheClusters` with `restore-failed`
(`CacheClusterStatus` has no `create-failed` value). A standalone cache cluster or Memcached
cluster that cannot be brought back reports `restore-failed` directly.

Reporting a failed record as failed matters more than it looks. A record that is left unreconciled
keeps its `available` status with nothing behind the endpoint, so the control plane answers healthy
while every connection fails, and the proxy port it still advertises is free for the next create to
take: the old endpoint then reaches an unrelated cache rather than failing cleanly.

A Memcached cluster's endpoint follows its new container. Outside Docker, Floci publishes the
backend on a host port Docker picks per run, so a restored cluster's `ConfigurationEndpoint` port
can differ from the one it had before the restart. Replication groups and standalone cache
clusters keep their port: it is a proxy port Floci owns and re-reserves.

A delete that arrives while a record is still `creating` wins. The restore takes the same
per-record monitor `DeleteReplicationGroup` and `DeleteCacheCluster` take, and skips its write-back
when the record is gone, so a group or cluster deleted in the first seconds after boot stays
deleted rather than coming back `available`. Any container the abandoned restore had already
started is stopped.

`DescribeReplicationGroups` reports the topology honestly: `ClusterEnabled`, one `NodeGroup` per
shard with its `Slots`, `NodeGroupMembers`, and `MemberClusters`. Each member also answers
`DescribeCacheClusters` (as on AWS), which is what terraform-provider-aws reads node type, engine
version and port from.

Cluster mode requires a Valkey 8.1+ image (the default `valkey/valkey:8` qualifies) for
`cluster-announce-client-ipv4` support. Each node consumes one port from the proxy range, so size
`FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_PROXY_BASE_PORT`/`_MAX_PORT` to the number of nodes you need.

```bash
aws elasticache create-replication-group \
  --replication-group-id my-sharded-cache \
  --replication-group-description "Sharded dev cache" \
  --engine valkey \
  --cache-parameter-group-name default.valkey8.cluster.on \
  --num-node-groups 2 \
  --replicas-per-node-group 1 \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

aws elasticache describe-replication-groups \
  --replication-group-id my-sharded-cache \
  --query 'ReplicationGroups[0].ConfigurationEndpoint' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

redis-cli -c -h localhost -p <configuration-endpoint-port> set mykey "hello"
```

### Cache Subnet Groups

A subnet group's VPC and each subnet's availability zone are read from the subnets themselves, as
AWS reads them, so the subnets have to exist in the emulator's EC2 first. Subnets that are unknown,
or that span more than one VPC, are refused the way AWS refuses them.

### Cache Parameter Groups

The `default.*` groups AWS publishes are listed for every family it supports, and cannot be modified
or deleted — AWS refuses those by the identifier rule, since a name it accepts cannot contain a dot.

floci does not carry AWS's per-family catalogue of parameter names, which runs to dozens per family.
It therefore stores whatever parameters a caller sets and reports them with source `user`, rather
than rejecting names a partial catalogue happens to be missing, which would refuse configurations
AWS accepts. `DescribeCacheParameters` returns those parameters; a request for `system` or
`engine-default` parameters returns none, and listings are unpaged.

A replication group that names a parameter group is refused with `CacheParameterGroupNotFound` when
no such group exists, and a parameter group still referenced by a replication group cannot be
deleted: `DeleteCacheParameterGroup` answers `InvalidCacheParameterGroupState` until that
replication group is gone. The reference counts from the moment `CreateReplicationGroup` accepts
the name, not from when the group is stored, so a delete that lands while that create is still
provisioning its container is refused too.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_PROXY_BASE_PORT` | `6379` | First host port in the ElastiCache proxy range |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_PROXY_MAX_PORT` | `6399` | Last host port in the ElastiCache proxy range |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ELASTICACHE_DEFAULT_IMAGE` | `valkey/valkey:8` | Docker image for Redis/Valkey containers |

### Docker Compose

ElastiCache requires the Docker socket and port range exposure. For private registry authentication and other Docker settings see [Docker Configuration](../configuration/docker.md).

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    ports:
      - "4566:4566"
      - "6379-6399:6379-6399"   # ElastiCache proxy ports
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_DOCKER_NETWORK: my-project_default
```

## Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Create a replication group (starts a Valkey container)
aws elasticache create-replication-group \
  --replication-group-id my-cache \
  --replication-group-description "Dev cache" \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Get the connection port
PORT=$(aws elasticache describe-replication-groups \
  --replication-group-id my-cache \
  --query 'ReplicationGroups[0].NodeGroups[0].PrimaryEndpoint.Port' \
  --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

# Connect with redis-cli
redis-cli -h localhost -p $PORT ping

# Use from your application
redis-cli -h localhost -p $PORT set mykey "hello"
redis-cli -h localhost -p $PORT get mykey

# Delete the cluster
aws elasticache delete-replication-group \
  --replication-group-id my-cache \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

## IAM Authentication

Floci supports ElastiCache IAM auth token validation. Create a user with access strings and validate tokens the same way real ElastiCache RBAC works.

```bash
# Create an ElastiCache user
aws elasticache create-user \
  --user-id alice \
  --user-name alice \
  --engine redis \
  --access-string "on ~* +@all" \
  --no-no-password-required \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```
