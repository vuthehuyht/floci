# AppSync

**Protocol:** REST JSON
**Endpoint:** `http://localhost:4566/v1/apis/...`

Floci implements the AWS AppSync Management API, providing local emulation of GraphQL API configuration, schema management, data source binding, resolver mapping, API key provisioning, custom domains, and channel namespaces.

## OIDC issuer network policy

AppSync OIDC authentication uses the shared JWT issuer policy. By default, issuer discovery and
JWKS requests require HTTPS and reject local, private, link-local, and other non-public addresses.
For an isolated development environment, set `FLOCI_SECURITY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_JWT_TARGETS=true`.
This also applies to API Gateway HTTP API JWT authorizers. The option permits private HTTPS
targets and HTTP URLs that use a literal private or loopback address.

## Schema Registry

Schema parsing and query execution run in the **GraphQL sidecar** (issue #2917), not in Floci's
own process: [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java) is a ~3.8MB dependency
used only by AppSync, so keeping it out of Floci's JVM/native image altogether, mirroring the
Cedar sidecar pattern already used for Verified Permissions, avoids paying that cost in every
build regardless of whether AppSync is ever used. The sidecar is `floci/floci-sidecar-graphql`,
published from [floci-io/floci-sidecars](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-sidecars) and pinned to
an exact version (a cached `latest` is never re-pulled): pull it ahead of time on an air-gapped
host with `docker pull floci/floci-sidecar-graphql:0.2.0`. `GraphqlSidecarManager` lazily starts
the sidecar container on first use and checks the contract version it reports on `/health`; a
sidecar speaking another contract major is refused immediately with an `InternalServerException`
naming the image and the variable to change. `floci.services.appsync.graphql-url` points at an
already-running instance instead (Docker Compose setups) and is checked the same way.

The sidecar itself carries no AppSync-specific knowledge: no `@aws_auth`, no IAM, no directive
semantics, and no AWS scalar vocabulary either. `StartSchemaCreation` sends the SDL (with
AppSync's directive declarations and the 17 custom scalar types injected, customers never declare
those themselves) plus a `scalars` mapping (each AppSync scalar name onto one of the sidecar's
generic coercion kinds, e.g. `AWSDateTime` onto `date-time`) to the sidecar's
`/v1/schema/validate`, which parses and compiles it generically. Invalid schemas are rejected
asynchronously (status `FAILED` with details after `PROCESSING`), using the sidecar's structured,
per-problem errors to build the same `codeErrors` shape this API always returned. Valid schemas
are registered in Floci's own `SchemaRegistry` (now just a raw-SDL cache; nothing is compiled
in-process) and persisted to the schema store.

At execution time, Floci calls the sidecar's `/v1/plan` to learn which `(type, field)` coordinates
a query will visit and what directives are on each, computes `@aws_auth`/IAM/Cognito/Lambda
authorization decisions itself (this AWS-specific logic never runs in the sidecar), and passes any
denied coordinates to `/v1/execute` as an opaque list; the sidecar nulls those fields out with the
given error, without ever knowing why.

On emulator startup, after storage load and orphan recovery, Floci **rehydrates** SUCCESS SDLs
from the schema store into `SchemaRegistry` so `POST /v1/apis/{apiId}/graphql` works across
restarts (memory/persistent/hybrid/wal), without re-validating against the sidecar, since a
persisted SDL already passed validation once and restarts shouldn't eagerly start a container that
might otherwise never be needed.

The following **AWS scalar types** are pre-registered and available in any schema without requiring explicit `scalar` declarations:

| Scalar | Java Type | Validation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| `AWSJSON` | String | Valid JSON syntax |
| `AWSDateTime` | String | ISO 8601 datetime |
| `AWSDate` | String | ISO 8601 date (yyyy-MM-dd) |
| `AWSTime` | String | ISO 8601 time |
| `AWSTimestamp` | Long | Unix epoch seconds (0 to 32503680000) |
| `AWSEmail` | String | RFC 5322 email format |
| `AWSURL` | String | Valid URL |
| `AWSPhone` | String | E.164 format (+1234567890) |
| `AWSIPAddress` | String | IPv4 or IPv6 |
| `AWSBoolean` | Boolean | Boolean value |
| `AWSLong` | Long | 64-bit signed integer |
| `AWSInteger` | Integer | 32-bit signed integer |
| `AWSShort` | Integer | 16-bit signed integer (-32768 to 32767) |
| `AWSFloat` | Double | IEEE 754 double-precision |
| `AWSBigDecimal` | String | Arbitrary-precision decimal |
| `AWSBigInt` | String | Arbitrary-precision integer |
| `AWSByte` | String | Base64-encoded byte array |

The following **AppSync directives** are pre-defined and recognized in schemas:

| Directive | Locations | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `@aws_api_key` | OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION | Require API key auth |
| `@aws_iam` | OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION | Require IAM auth |
| `@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: [String!]!)` | OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION | Require Cognito user pool auth |
| `@aws_oidc` | OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION | Require OIDC auth |
| `@aws_lambda` | OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION | Require Lambda auth |
| `@aws_subscribe(mutations: [String!]!)` | FIELD_DEFINITION | Link subscription to mutation |
| `@aws_auth(cognito_groups: [String!]!)` | OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION | Require Cognito groups (ignored when additional auth modes exist) |
| `@aws_delta_sync` | OBJECT | Delta sync configuration |

Unknown directives are rejected during schema registration.

Schema extensions (`extend type Query { ... }`) are supported natively through graphql-java, running in the sidecar.

## GraphQL execute (data-plane)

| Surface | Path | Content-Types |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP GraphQL | `POST /v1/apis/{apiId}/graphql` | `application/json`, `application/graphql` (+ charset) |

Execute is a **separate** data-plane endpoint from the management API. Request body is GraphQL-over-HTTP JSON: `{ "query", "variables?", "operationName?" }`.

Responses are `application/json` with AWS AppSync wire shapes (`data` / `errors[]` with top-level `errorType` / `errorInfo`). Most GraphQL syntax and validation errors return **HTTP 200** with `errors[]`.

| Case | HTTP | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Query / introspection / validation / syntax (incl. blank `query`) | 200 | Fields with an `APPSYNC_JS` resolver or a VTL UNIT resolver over `NONE` are resolved (see [Resolver execution](#resolver-execution)). A field with no resolver is `null` |
| HTTP subscription operation | 200 | `OperationNotSupported` (realtime WebSocket is a later phase) |
| Empty body / `{}` / `[]` / unparseable JSON / bad Content-Type | 400 | `MalformedHttpRequestException` |
| Missing `operationName` with multiple operations | 400 | `BadRequestException` — `Missing operation name.` |
| Unknown `apiId` | 404 | `NotFoundException` |
| API exists but no executable schema (incl. PROCESSING) | **502** | `GraphQLSchemaException` — `No schema definition exists.` + `x-amzn-errortype` |
| Unexpected failure | 500 | `InternalFailure` |
| Missing/invalid/expired credentials, unconfigured mode, Lambda deny | **401** | `UnauthorizedException` — GraphQL does not run; `x-amzn-errortype` is set. Missing headers use message `Missing authorization header`. |
| Field directive mismatch, Cognito group miss, Lambda `deniedFields`, IAM field DENY | **200** | Field is `null` and `errors[]` contains `Unauthorized` — `Not Authorized to access {field} on type {type}` (no `x-amzn-errortype`) |

**Evidence for data-plane statuses** (empty/`[]`/`{}` → 400; missing schema → 502): AppSync team sample in [graphql/graphql-over-http#81](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/issues/81) (@robzhu). The management API Reference lists `GraphQLSchemaException` as HTTP 400 for “schema not valid” on management operations — a different surface than the GraphQL execute data plane.

### Execute authentication

Request auth runs after Content-Type and body parse and after API lookup (unknown `apiId` is still 404). It runs before schema lookup, so a missing schema with no credentials is 401, not 502.

Headers are classified by **shape** (not primary-then-fallback). If both `x-api-key` and SigV4 `Authorization` are present, **SigV4 wins**. AppSync does not fall back to the API key when IAM validation fails.

Missing required auth headers return HTTP **401** `UnauthorizedException` with message `Missing authorization header`. Invalid or expired credentials that are present still return 401 with `You are not authorized to make this call.`

| Header shape | Mode |
|---|---|
| `Authorization` starts with `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256` | `AWS_IAM` (wins over `x-api-key` if both are present) |
| `x-api-key` present | `API_KEY` |
| `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` | Cognito and/or OIDC (matched by `iss` / `aud` or `azp`) |
| Other `Authorization` | `AWS_LAMBDA` |

Configured modes are the API default `authenticationType` plus `additionalAuthenticationProviders`. A classified mode that is not configured returns 401.

| Mode | Emulator notes |
|---|---|
| API_KEY | Lookup by `ApiKey.id`, which is the key value (`da2-…`). Identity is absent (not `{}`). Default key expiry is 7 days when `expires` is omitted; stored `expires` is rounded down to the nearest hour. Create/UpdateApiKey require `expires` between 1 and 365 days from now (`ApiKeyValidityOutOfBoundsException`, 400). `deletes` is `expires` plus 60 days. |
| AWS_IAM | Verifies a real header-signed SigV4 request (`appsync` service, fixed `/v1/apis/{apiId}/graphql` canonical path, 5-minute clock skew): the `Credential=` access key must resolve to a secret via `IamService`, and the signature must match. The legacy `test`/`test` pair is still emulator ALLOW, but it must be signed with secret `test` like any other key, and it is not a bypass. A temporary (`ASIA...`) credential must also present the `X-Amz-Security-Token` header matching the one issued for it. An unknown or unsigned key is always 401 and never becomes the account-root identity. Known keys additionally evaluate `appsync:GraphQL`. |
| Cognito / OIDC | JWT signature is verified, not just decoded. Cognito checks the token against the issuing user pool's own RS256 signing key (`alg`, `kid`, issuer, audience/`clientId`, expiry); OIDC checks it against the configured issuer's published JWKS (via OIDC discovery), the same way the HTTP API JWT authorizer does. Both fail closed: an unreachable issuer, unsupported algorithm (including `none`), unmatched `kid`, or bad signature is 401. OIDC as the sole mode still skips the token's own `iss` claim check, but the signature is always verified against the configured issuer's keys. OIDC identity is `{sub, issuer, claims}` (no `sourceIp`). |
| Lambda | AppSync `isAuthorized` contract via `LambdaService.invoke` (not an API Gateway policy document). |

SDL field auth: unmarked fields require the API **default** mode. Additional modes unlock fields tagged `@aws_api_key` / `@aws_iam` / `@aws_oidc` / `@aws_cognito_user_pools` / `@aws_lambda`. Multiple directives on a field are OR. Field-level directives override type-level. `@aws_auth` is allowed on `OBJECT \| FIELD_DEFINITION` and is ignored when additional modes exist.

Duplicate `API_KEY` / `AWS_IAM` / `AWS_LAMBDA` (and the same Cognito pool or OIDC issuer) between default and additional providers is rejected on create/update with management 400 `BadRequestException`: `Authentication type {TYPE} for additional authentication provider {N} already specified on the API. It can only be specified once.` (`N` is 1-based in `additionalAuthenticationProviders`).

## Resolver execution

A field with an `APPSYNC_JS` resolver is executed, not stubbed: the resolver's own code runs, its
data source is called, and the field gets the value the code returned. Floci also executes
`2018-05-29` VTL request and response templates for UNIT resolvers backed by a `NONE` data source.
VTL pipeline stages and VTL resolvers over other data sources remain explicit unsupported
operations rather than silently resolving to `null`.

### How a resolver gets called

The GraphQL engine runs in the `floci-sidecar-graphql` container, so the sidecar walks the query and
Floci owns the resolvers. `POST /v1/execute` carries a `resolve` block naming every coordinate the
query touches that has a resolver, plus a callback URL and a token minted for that one operation.
The sidecar then batches each execution level into a single `POST /_floci/appsync/resolve`, Floci runs each
field's resolver and answers with a value or an error, and a value becomes the `source` of that
field's own children. The contract is [`graphql/API.md`](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-sidecars/blob/main/graphql/API.md)
in floci-io/floci-sidecars.

Field authorization is applied before any of this: a denied coordinate is never listed in `resolve`,
so it cannot reach a resolver. The token stops working the moment the operation returns.

One AppSync behaviour does not fit the callback response, which carries a value or an error per
field and never both: `util.appendError` means "report this **and** keep the data". Those errors
come back to Floci on the operation's session instead and are merged into the response envelope, so
a resolver that appends errors still returns its data alongside them.

### How the code runs

Resolver JavaScript runs in a **Node sidecar container**, started lazily on the first JS resolver
and reused for every evaluation after it. Floci's published image is a Mandrel native executable,
which carries no Truffle languages, so there is no in-process JavaScript to embed; running real Node
also means a bundle executes as written, ES modules and all.

Node is the engine, but **the APPSYNC_JS subset is enforced before evaluation**. AWS runs resolvers
on a restricted runtime, not Node, so code using Node-only capabilities would run locally and be
rejected on deploy. Accepting it here would mean local runs green-light resolvers that cannot ship,
which is the one failure an emulator must not have.

`@aws-appsync/utils` and `@aws-appsync/utils/rds` resolve to a shim the sidecar writes at boot, not
the published package, so a resolver call never depends on npm being reachable. Covered:
`util.error` / `appendError` / `unauthorized`, `util.autoId`, `util.time.*`, `util.dynamodb.*`,
`util.parseJson` / `toJson` and the type predicates, `runtime.earlyReturn`, `extensions.*` (accepted,
no-ops), and from `/rds`: `toJsonObject`, `sql`, `select`, `insert`, `update`, `remove`,
`createPgStatement` and `typeHint`. Anything outside that set throws by name rather than answering
`undefined`, so a gap is visible instead of silent. `@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb` covers `get`,
`put` and `remove`; `update`, `scan`, `query`, `sync` and `operations` compile a condition or update
expression and are not implemented, so they throw by name.

### What is rejected

| Construct | Why |
|---|---|
| `async` functions, `await`, promises | AWS's runtime has no async support at all |
| `import` of anything but `@aws-appsync/utils[/rds\|/dynamodb]` | resolvers have no filesystem or network access |
| `class`, `while`, `do...while`, generators, `yield` | not available in APPSYNC_JS |
| `try` / `catch` / `finally`, `throw` | not available; use `util.error` |
| `this`, `with`, `eval`, `debugger`, `require` | not available |

An `async` handler is caught before it runs, a handler returning a promise is caught after, and
imports are blocked by a module resolve hook, so a dynamic `import()` cannot slip past the source
scan. The scan blanks comments, strings and template text first, so the same keywords inside them
are not flagged. Recursion is also unavailable on AWS and is not detected, since that cannot be
determined lexically.

A rejected resolver fails its field with `errorType: UnsupportedFeature` and the line number, rather
than running.

### VTL UNIT resolvers

A VTL UNIT resolver over `NONE` evaluates the request mapping template, unwraps the request's
`payload`, and evaluates the response mapping template with that value in `ctx.result`. Request
templates must render a JSON object with `version: "2018-05-29"`; invalid JSON and unsupported
versions fail the field with `errorType: MappingTemplate`.

The VTL context includes `ctx.arguments` / `ctx.args`, `ctx.source`, `ctx.stash`, `ctx.result`,
`ctx.error`, `ctx.identity`, `ctx.request`, `ctx.info`, and `ctx.prev`. Stash mutations survive from
the request template to the response template. `#return` returns its value from the resolver,
skipping the remaining template and data-source work. `$util.error` fails the field with its
selected type and details, and
`$util.appendError` reports an error beside the returned data.

The existing VTL loop, output-size, timeout, and reflection-sandbox limits apply. The
`2017-02-28` template version, VTL pipeline functions, and VTL-backed DynamoDB, Lambda, RDS, and
other data sources are not included in this first execution slice.

| Setting | Env | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.enabled` | `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_JS_RUNTIME_ENABLED` | `true` |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.enforce-appsync-subset` | … `_ENFORCE_APPSYNC_SUBSET` | `true` |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.url` | `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_JS_RUNTIME_URL` | unset |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.image` | `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_JS_RUNTIME_IMAGE` | `node:22-alpine` |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.container-name` | `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_JS_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_NAME` | `appsync-js-runtime` |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.port` | `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_JS_RUNTIME_PORT` | `0` (Docker picks) |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.start-timeout-seconds` | … `_START_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `60` |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.evaluation-timeout-seconds` | … `_EVALUATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` |
| `floci.services.appsync.js-runtime.keep-running-on-shutdown` | … `_KEEP_RUNNING_ON_SHUTDOWN` | `false` |

Set `url` to point at a Node server someone is already running, in which case Floci skips container
management entirely and never starts, adopts or stops anything. That is the same contract as
`floci.services.duck.url`, and it is the way to work on the sidecar itself or to run somewhere with
no Docker socket to reach.

Otherwise resolver execution needs Docker. Without it, a JS resolver fails its field with a message
naming the sidecar; the management API is unaffected. The container is stopped through
`ContainerTeardown` along with the other process-bound containers.

### Pipelines

A UNIT resolver is `request()` → data source → `response()`. A PIPELINE resolver runs its own
`request()` as the before step, then each function in `pipelineConfig.functions` in order as its own
request / data source / response, then its `response()` as the after step.

- `ctx.stash` is threaded through every stage, so the before step can hand work to the functions.
- Each stage sees the previous one's return value as `ctx.prev.result`.
- A function that exports no `response()` passes its data source result straight through.
- `runtime.earlyReturn(value)` makes `value` the field's result immediately, skipping every
  remaining stage including the after step.
- `util.error(...)` fails the field, carrying the resolver's own `errorType`, `errorInfo` and `data`
  onto the GraphQL error.
- `util.appendError(...)` stops nothing: the errors are returned **beside** the data.
- A **data source failure** does not fail the field by itself. The stage's `response()` handler is
  called with `ctx.error` set to `{message, type}` and no `ctx.result`, and it decides: re-raise
  with `util.error` / collect with `util.appendError`, or return a value and **suppress** the error.
  Suppression is AWS behaviour, and it is why resolvers carry an explicit `if (ctx.error)` branch:
  without one a failed query silently returns whatever the handler returned. A stage that exports
  no `response()` has nothing to make that decision, so there the error fails the field.

`ctx` carries `arguments` / `args`, `source`, `stash`, `prev`, `identity`, `request.authType`,
`info` (`fieldName`, `parentTypeName`, `variables`, `selectionSetList`) and `env` (the API's
environment variables). `ctx.request.headers` is empty: the GraphQL context does not carry them.

### Data sources

| Type | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `NONE` | The request is the result; a `payload` member is unwrapped, as on AWS. Supports APPSYNC_JS and `2018-05-29` VTL UNIT resolvers. |
| `AWS_LAMBDA` | `Invoke` and `BatchInvoke`. Only `payload` reaches the function. A function error fails the field rather than resolving to the error object. |
| `RELATIONAL_DATABASE` | Statements run over the RDS Data API against `rdsHttpEndpointConfig`. Accepts `{statements, variableMap}`, the `{statement, parameters}` the `/rds` helpers build, a list of either, or a bare SQL string. `variableTypeHintMap` is honoured, without it a bound date binds as text and PostgreSQL refuses the comparison (`operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone >= character varying`), so a resolver's date filters need it. The result is wrapped as `{sqlStatementResults: […]}`, which is what `toJsonObject()` reads. |
| `AMAZON_DYNAMODB` | `GetItem`, `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`, `Query`, `Scan`, through the native DynamoDB path so expressions, conditions and indexes all apply. Items come back as **plain JSON**, not attribute values, as AppSync returns them. `nextToken` is an opaque encoding of `LastEvaluatedKey`. `BatchGetItem`, `TransactWriteItems` and `Sync` are not implemented and say so. |
| `HTTP`, `AMAZON_EVENTBRIDGE`, `AMAZON_OPENSEARCH_SERVICE`, `AMAZON_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` | Not implemented; a resolver using one fails its field naming the type. |

A field with no resolver falls back to reading its value off the parent object, which is how the
fields of an object a resolver returned are populated.

## Pagination

All `List` operations support cursor-based pagination via query parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `maxResults` | Maximum number of items to return |
| `nextToken` | Opaque token for the next page |

The `nextToken` is a Base64 URL-encoded integer offset. A missing token starts from offset 0. An invalid token returns `InvalidNextTokenException` (400).

```bash
# First page
aws appsync list-graphql-apis \
  --max-results 10 \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Next page (use the nextToken from previous response)
aws appsync list-graphql-apis \
  --max-results 10 \
  --next-token "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjEwfQ==" \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

## Cascade Delete

Deleting a GraphQL API (`DeleteGraphqlApi`) automatically deletes all child resources:

- Schema and schema creation status
- All data sources
- All resolvers
- All functions
- All types
- All API keys
- All channel namespaces
- All domain name associations

This matches AWS behavior where deleting an API removes its entire configuration.

## Not Implemented

These AWS AppSync capabilities are not yet implemented and are tracked in future phases:

- **VTL resolver expansion**: pipeline functions, the `2017-02-28` version, and data sources beyond `NONE`
- **Data source adapters** (Phase 9): DynamoDB, Lambda, HTTP, EventBridge, OpenSearch, RDS connectors
- **Guardrails** (Phase 10): query depth / complexity limits and related errors
- **Realtime subscriptions** (Phase 11+): WebSocket real-time subscriptions
- **Caching**: API-level and per-resolver caching
- **Merged API source management**: `AssociateMergedGraphqlApi`, `AssociateSourceGraphqlApi`, `StartSchemaMerge`, `ListTypesByAssociation`
- **Data source introspection**: `StartDataSourceIntrospection`, `GetDataSourceIntrospection`

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_VTL_MAX_LOOPS` | `10000` | Maximum `#foreach` iterations a VTL resolver template may execute |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_VTL_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` | `1048576` | Maximum characters a VTL resolver template may render |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_APPSYNC_VTL_TIMEOUT_MILLIS` | `5000` | Maximum wall-clock time a VTL resolver template may spend evaluating |

Request/response mapping templates render inside the same VTL reflection sandbox described for
API Gateway in [api-gateway.md](api-gateway.md#configuration) (`SecureUberspector`, with `Class`,
`ClassLoader`, `Runtime`, `ProcessBuilder`, `System`, `Thread`, `java.io.File` and related
classes/packages blocked), and are subject to the same three limits above. The loop cap truncates
a `#foreach` at the configured iteration count and lets the template finish rendering with
whatever output it produced up to that point; it does not fail the resolver. Exceeding the
output-size or execution-time limit does fail the resolver, the same way any other VTL evaluation
error does.
