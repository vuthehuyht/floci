# API Gateway

Floci supports both API Gateway v1 (REST APIs) and API Gateway v2 (HTTP APIs).

## Custom API IDs

API IDs are generated randomly, which means endpoint URLs change every time you recreate an API. To pin
one, pass the reserved `floci:override-id` tag on creation and Floci uses its value as the API ID. This
works for both v1 (`CreateRestApi`) and v2 (`CreateApi`), and matches the tag other services such as KMS
and Cognito already use.

```bash
aws apigateway create-rest-api \
  --name my-api \
  --tags '{"floci:override-id":"my-fixed-id","env":"test"}' \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
# the API is now reachable at the stable id "my-fixed-id"
```

The override key is consumed rather than stored, so it never appears in the tags the API returns. Any
other tags in the same request are kept. Because an ID cannot change after creation, supplying either
override key to `TagResource` is rejected with `BadRequestException`.

Values must be non-blank and must not contain whitespace, control characters, or `/`, `?`, `#`, since
those would break the endpoint URL. An invalid value is rejected with `BadRequestException`.

Creating a second API with an override ID that already exists in the region is rejected with
`ConflictException` instead of overwriting the existing API, matching how KMS and Cognito treat
duplicate override IDs.

> [!NOTE]
> API Gateway previously used a `_custom_id_` tag for this. It still works so existing setups keep
> running, and it is now stripped from the returned tags the same way, but it is deprecated: prefer
> `floci:override-id`. If both are present, `floci:override-id` wins, which lets you set both during a
> migration. The `_custom_id_` key is API Gateway specific and is not reserved for any other service.

### API Key Behaviour Notes

#### `CreateApiKey` and `ImportApiKeys` share one route

Both operations are `POST /apikeys`, and AWS tells them apart by the query string, not by
`Content-Type`: `ImportApiKeys` carries `?mode=import&format=csv` and a CSV body, `CreateApiKey`
carries no query parameters and a JSON body. The SDKs send `ImportApiKeys` with no `Content-Type`
header at all, so Floci accepts any media type on this route and dispatches on `mode`.

The CSV header row is addressed by name, not position. AWS's own column set is
`Name,Key,Description,Enabled,UsagePlanIds`; a `Key` column is required, and a missing `Enabled`
column defaults to `true`. Duplicate key values are reported in the `warnings` array, and
`failonwarnings=true` turns those warnings into a `BadRequestException`.

#### `generateDistinctId`

Controls whether the key's `id` and `value` fields are distinct. AWS's undocumented default behaviour is that they are **the same string** unless `generateDistinctId=true` is explicitly requested.

| `generateDistinctId` | `id` | `value` |
|---|---|---|
| absent (default) | same as `value` | caller-supplied `value`, or a generated UUID-derived string |
| `false` | same as `value` | caller-supplied `value`, or a generated UUID-derived string |
| `true` | opaque short token (`shortId`) | caller-supplied `value`, or a generated UUID-derived string |

When `generateDistinctId` is absent or `false`, a single shared string is used for both `id` and `value`. If the caller supplies a `value` in the request body, that string is used for both; otherwise a UUID-derived string is generated and assigned to both.

When `generateDistinctId=true`, `id` is set to an opaque short token independent of `value`.

#### Revocation

`DeleteApiKey` detaches the key from every usage plan before removing it, matching AWS. A usage plan key
stores its own copy of the key value, so without that sweep a deleted key would stay listed by
`GetUsagePlanKeys` and keep being recognised on the data plane.

`requestContext.identity.apiKey` is only populated when the `x-api-key` header matches a key that still
exists and has `enabled` set to `true`, so disabling a key through `UpdateApiKey` takes effect
immediately.

> [!NOTE]
> Floci does not implement the `apiKeyRequired` gate on methods, so a request carrying an unknown,
> disabled, or deleted key is still executed — it simply arrives with a null `identity.apiKey` rather
> than being rejected with `403`.

### Custom Domain Names

A domain created with `CreateDomainName` is `AVAILABLE` at once. Its `regionalDomainName` is
`<domain>.regional.local`, and a request whose `Host` header is either that name or the domain
itself is routed through the domain's base path mappings to the mapped REST API stage. An
`EDGE` domain also reports a `distributionDomainName` under `cloudfront.net` and the fixed
CloudFront hosted zone `Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`; a `REGIONAL` domain reports neither, as on AWS. Moving a
domain between the two types with `UpdateDomainName` creates or drops the distribution.
`GetDomainName` returns the `domainNameArn`, the `endpointConfiguration`, both certificate ARNs
and the `tags`. Tags are managed through `TagResource`, `UntagResource` and `GetTags` on
`arn:aws:apigateway:<region>::/domainnames/<domain>`. A second mapping on a base path that
already has one is a `ConflictException`. A `PRIVATE` endpoint type is refused: private custom
domains are not emulated. Mutual TLS, ownership verification certificates, routing modes and
endpoint access modes are accepted and ignored.

With TLS enabled, `CreateDomainName` also adds the domain to Floci's server certificate, so
`https://<domain>` verifies against the ACM chain without a restart. The name must sit under a
local suffix such as `localhost.floci.io`; see [TLS](../configuration/tls.md).

Templates can create domains and mappings with `AWS::ApiGateway::DomainName` and
`AWS::ApiGateway::BasePathMapping`; see [CloudFormation](cloudformation.md).

### IAM Authorization (`AWS_IAM`) {#iam-authorization}

A method (v1) or route (v2) whose `authorizationType` is `AWS_IAM` requires a SigV4-signed caller.
Before the integration runs, the signature is verified against the request as it arrived (method,
path, query string, the headers named in `SignedHeaders`, and the SHA-256 of the body). Both
placements AWS accepts are honoured: an `Authorization` header and a presigned query string
(`X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`). The credential must be scoped to the `execute-api` service.

Temporary credentials must also present the session token they were issued with, as
`X-Amz-Security-Token` (a header, or a query parameter on a presigned request). The token is
compared against the value recorded when STS minted the credential, so a missing or fabricated one
is rejected: the secret alone is not the whole credential. Whether the token is covered by
`SignedHeaders` is not required either way, since SigV4 leaves that service-specific.

Rejections are `403`, and never reach the integration:

| Condition | REST (v1) `message` / `x-amzn-ErrorType` | HTTP API (v2) |
|---|---|---|
| No SigV4 credentials at all | `Missing Authentication Token` / `MissingAuthenticationTokenException` | `Forbidden` |
| Credentials present but incomplete, or scoped to another service | `Incomplete Signature` / `IncompleteSignatureException` | `Forbidden` |
| Access key the emulator never issued | `The security token included in the request is invalid.` / `UnrecognizedClientException` | `Forbidden` |
| Temporary credential presenting no `X-Amz-Security-Token`, or one that is not the token it was issued | `The security token included in the request is invalid.` / `UnrecognizedClientException` | `Forbidden` |
| `X-Amz-Date` outside the 5-minute window, or a presigned URL past `X-Amz-Expires` | `Signature expired` / `InvalidSignatureException` | `Forbidden` |
| Signature mismatch | `The request signature we calculated does not match…` / `InvalidSignatureException` | `Forbidden` |

A verified caller reaches the integration as `requestContext.identity.{accessKey, accountId, caller,
user, userArn}` on a REST proxy event, and as `requestContext.authorizer.iam` on an HTTP API 2.0
event.

Sign with any access key the emulator has issued (`CreateAccessKey`, or the temporary credentials
from `AssumeRole`), or with the well-known local-dev `test`/`test` pair that Floci accepts across
S3, RDS, and ElastiCache. No other unregistered key is accepted: an unknown key cannot sign for
itself. Any AWS SDK sends the session token automatically, so temporary credentials need no special
handling; a hand-rolled signer must include it.

> [!NOTE]
> A session minted before Floci recorded session tokens (one restored from a persisted store
> written by an earlier version) has no issued token to compare against. Such a credential must
> still present a token, but its value cannot be checked. Re-minting it with `AssumeRole` restores
> the full check.

> [!NOTE]
> Floci authenticates the caller but does not authorize the call: it does not evaluate
> `execute-api:Invoke` against the caller's IAM policies or a resource policy, so any validly
> signed, known caller is let through. `principalOrgId` and `cognitoIdentity` are always null -
> Organizations membership and identity-pool federation are not modelled.

### Not Implemented

These management-plane operations have no handler in v1. Calls will return `404` or an error:

- Authorizer testing: `TestInvokeAuthorizer`
- Model templates: `GetModelTemplate`
- Gateway Responses (the entire family: `PutGatewayResponse`, `GetGatewayResponse`, etc.)
- Documentation parts and versions (the entire family, 10 operations)
- VPC Links (5 operations)
- Client Certificates (5 operations)
- `GetExport` / `ImportDocumentationParts`

The execute plane (actual proxied HTTP traffic via `/restapis/{id}/{stage}/_user_request_/…`) is implemented separately and is not counted as management-plane operations. It supports `AWS_PROXY` (Lambda proxy), `AWS` (Lambda with VTL request/response templates), and `MOCK` integrations; other integration types return an error. A `MOCK` integration renders its request template and uses the `statusCode` it produces to pick the integration response, exactly as AWS does: the first response whose `selectionPattern` matches wins, otherwise the response without a pattern (the default) answers. This is what makes CORS preflights declared with a `204` response (CDK's `addCorsPreflight`) carry their `Access-Control-*` headers.

### Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Create a REST API
API_ID=$(aws apigateway create-rest-api \
  --name "My API" \
  --query id --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

# Get the root resource
ROOT_ID=$(aws apigateway get-resources \
  --rest-api-id $API_ID \
  --query 'items[?path==`/`].id' --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

# Create a resource
RESOURCE_ID=$(aws apigateway create-resource \
  --rest-api-id $API_ID \
  --parent-id $ROOT_ID \
  --path-part users \
  --query id --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

# Add a GET method
aws apigateway put-method \
  --rest-api-id $API_ID \
  --resource-id $RESOURCE_ID \
  --http-method GET \
  --authorization-type NONE \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Add a Lambda integration
aws apigateway put-integration \
  --rest-api-id $API_ID \
  --resource-id $RESOURCE_ID \
  --http-method GET \
  --type AWS_PROXY \
  --integration-http-method POST \
  --uri "arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:000000000000:function:my-function/invocations" \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Deploy to a stage
aws apigateway create-deployment \
  --rest-api-id $API_ID \
  --stage-name dev \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Call the deployed API
curl http://localhost:4566/restapis/$API_ID/dev/_user_request_/users
```

### Usage Plan Tags and Custom IDs

Usage plans accept arbitrary tags, and the same reserved `floci:override-id` tag used for
[custom API IDs](#custom-api-ids) pins the plan's `id`:

```bash
# Create a usage plan with a custom ID and additional tags
aws apigateway create-usage-plan \
  --name "my-plan" \
  --tags '{"floci:override-id":"my-plan-id","env":"staging"}' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# The plan is now accessible at its custom ID
aws apigateway get-usage-plans --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

The override key is validated and consumed exactly as it is for `CreateRestApi`, so it never appears in
the tags a usage plan returns. The deprecated `_custom_id_` key is still honored on create for existing
setups, and `floci:override-id` wins when both are present. Every other tag is persisted and returned in
`CreateUsagePlan` and `GetUsagePlans` responses.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_APIGATEWAY_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable API Gateway v1 (REST APIs) |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_APIGATEWAYV2_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable API Gateway v2 (HTTP and WebSocket APIs) |

## API Gateway v2 (HTTP and WebSocket APIs) {#v2}

**Protocol:** REST JSON
**Endpoint:** `http://localhost:4566/v2/apis/...`

Both HTTP and WebSocket protocol types are fully supported, including the WebSocket data-plane (real connection handling, message routing, and the `@connections` management API).

### HTTP API data-plane

API Gateway v2 advertises HTTP APIs through Floci's local execute-api domain:

```bash
curl http://{apiId}.execute-api.localhost.floci.io:4566/{stageName}/{path}
```

When an API has a `$default` stage, callers may omit the stage segment:

```bash
curl http://{apiId}.execute-api.localhost.floci.io:4566/{path}
```

APIs created or updated with `disableExecuteApiEndpoint` reject requests to
this default hostname with `404 Not Found`, matching AWS HTTP API behavior.

Routes carrying `authorizationType: AWS_IAM`: including those an OpenAPI import resolves from an
`awsSigv4` security scheme: require a signed caller; see
[IAM Authorization](#iam-authorization).

### WebSocket Data-Plane {#websocket-data-plane}

Floci supports real WebSocket connections for API Gateway v2 WebSocket APIs. Clients connect via:

```
ws://localhost:4566/ws/{apiId}/{stageName}
```

#### Supported Features

| Custom routes via `routeSelectionExpression` | ✅ |
| Route response selection expression | ✅ |
| Lambda REQUEST authorizer on `$connect` | ✅ |
| Identity source validation (header/querystring) | ✅ |

| 2-hour max connection duration | ✅ |

#### @connections Management API

The `@connections` API allows server-side code (e.g., Lambda functions) to send messages to connected clients, retrieve connection metadata, or disconnect clients:

```
POST   /execute-api/{apiId}/{stageName}/@connections/{connectionId}  — Send message
GET    /execute-api/{apiId}/{stageName}/@connections/{connectionId}  — Get connection info
DELETE /execute-api/{apiId}/{stageName}/@connections/{connectionId}  — Disconnect client
```

#### Behavior Notes

- **Connection URL**: Floci accepts the AWS-style execute-api host as well as the path form. All of these reach the same WebSocket API:
  - `ws://{apiId}.execute-api.{region}.localhost:4566/{stage}` — region-bearing, mirroring AWS's `wss://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}`
  - `ws://{apiId}.execute-api.localhost.floci.io:4566/{stage}` — Floci's built-in execute-api domain (regionless; the region is resolved by an apiId lookup)
  - `ws://localhost:4566/ws/{apiId}/{stage}` — the explicit path form

  The `@connections` management API is likewise reachable on the execute-api host (`http://{apiId}.execute-api.{region}.localhost:4566/{stage}/@connections/{connectionId}`).
- **Idle timeout**: 10 minutes (matching AWS default). Not configurable per-API.
- **Max connection duration**: 2 hours (matching AWS). Connections are closed automatically.
- **Payload size limit**: 128 KB per frame (matching AWS). Oversized messages receive an error frame.

### Not Implemented

- `ExportApi`, `UpdateDomainName`, `UpdateApiMapping`
- `UpdateVpcLink` — the other four VPC Link operations are implemented; see the table above
