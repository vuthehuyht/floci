# AWS DataSync

**Protocol:** JSON 1.1 (`X-Amz-Target: FmrsService.<Action>`)
**Endpoint:** `http://localhost:4566/` (SigV4 service `datasync`)

DataSync's Smithy service shape is `FmrsService`, so that is the target prefix the SDK and
the CLI send, not the service name. Floci emulates the management plane: agents, locations,
tasks and tagging. The task-execution data plane is not emulated.

<!-- floci:actions:end -->

Agents report `ONLINE` and tasks report `AVAILABLE` on the first read after they are
created, so SDK and Terraform waiters, including the one behind `aws_datasync_task`,
complete on their first poll. Tags passed on any create are honoured and come back from
`ListTagsForResource`.

Each `DescribeLocation*` projects the create request that produced the location, so the
configuration you sent is the configuration you read back. `LocationUri` is derived from
the same request the way AWS documents it, per location type:

| Location type | `LocationUri` |
|---|---|
| S3 | `s3://<bucket>/<subdirectory>` |
| EFS | `efs://<region>.<file-system-id>/<subdirectory>` |
| FSx for Lustre | `fsxl://<region>.<file-system-id>/<subdirectory>` |
| FSx for OpenZFS | `fsxz://<region>.<file-system-id>/<subdirectory>` |
| FSx for Windows | `fsxw://<region>.<file-system-id>/<subdirectory>` |
| FSx for ONTAP | `fsxn://<region>.<file-system-id>.<svm-id>/<subdirectory>` |
| HDFS | `hdfs://<namenode-hostname>:<port>/<subdirectory>` |
| NFS | `nfs://<server-hostname>/<subdirectory>` |
| SMB | `smb://<server-hostname>/<subdirectory>` |
| Object storage | `object-storage://<server-hostname>/<bucket>/<subdirectory>` |
| Azure Blob | `azure-blob://<account-host>/<container>/<subdirectory>` |

DataSync's documented server-side defaults are applied on create and returned on describe:
`S3StorageClass` `STANDARD`, Azure Blob `BLOCK` and `HOT`, object storage `HTTPS` on port
443 (80 for `HTTP`), SMB `NTLM` authentication, NFS and SMB mount version `AUTOMATIC`, HDFS
block size 128 MiB with replication factor 3 and `PRIVACY` QOP, EFS `InTransitEncryption`
`NONE`, and the full `Options` block on a task. `DescribeLocationFsxOntap` derives
`FsxFilesystemArn` from the storage virtual machine ARN, as AWS does.

A task's `VerifyMode` default follows its `TaskMode`. A `BASIC` task, which is what
`CreateTask` assumes when the request omits `TaskMode`, defaults to
`POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT`. An `ENHANCED` task defaults to `ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED` and
cannot use `POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT` at all, so asking for that combination fails with
`InvalidRequestException`. `UpdateTaskRequest` carries no `TaskMode`, so a task keeps the
mode it was created with and `UpdateTask` applies the same rule against that stored mode.

## Not emulated

The task-execution data plane (`StartTaskExecution`, `DescribeTaskExecution`,
`ListTaskExecutions`, `CancelTaskExecution` and `UpdateTaskExecution`) transfers real bytes
between real storage systems, which floci has no way to model. These operations return
`UnknownOperationException` rather than a stub success, so a caller fails fast instead of
waiting on a transfer that will never progress.

Credential members are accepted on create but never stored or returned: `Password`,
`SecretKey`, Azure `SasConfiguration`, `KerberosKeytab` and `KerberosKrb5Conf`, plus the
nested `Protocol.SMB.Password` on the FSx protocol block. AWS also omits them from every
describe response. Because no secret is created, `ManagedSecretConfig` is not returned;
`CmkSecretConfig` and `CustomSecretConfig` are echoed as sent.

Agent ARNs referenced by a location (`AgentArns`, `OnPremConfig.AgentArns`) are not checked
against the agents floci knows about, so a location can point at an agent that was
provisioned elsewhere. Location ARNs on `CreateTask` are checked, and an unknown one fails
with `InvalidRequestException`.

DataSync models only `InvalidRequestException` and `InternalException`, so a missing
resource, a required member that was not sent, and a describe aimed at the wrong location
type all return `InvalidRequestException` with HTTP 400. There is no
`ResourceNotFoundException` in this API.

## Configuration
