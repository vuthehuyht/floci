## Behavior

- All distributions are immediately set to `Deployed` state (no async `InProgress` delay).
- Distribution IDs are 14 uppercase alphanumeric characters starting with `E` (e.g. `E1Z2X3C4V5B6N7`).
- Distribution domain names follow the pattern `{id}.cloudfront.net`, with the id lower-cased as AWS
  writes it in a host name.
- Public key IDs are `K` followed by 13 uppercase alphanumeric characters (e.g. `K2JCJMDEHXQW5F`),
  the value a signed URL carries as `Key-Pair-Id`. Key group, cache policy, origin request policy and
  response headers policy IDs are UUIDs, as they are on AWS.
- ARNs are global — no region segment: `arn:aws:cloudfront::{accountId}:distribution/{id}`.
- Invalidations are immediately marked `Completed`.
- `DeleteDistribution` returns `DistributionNotDisabled` (409) if `Enabled` is `true` in the config.
- All mutating operations (`PUT`, `DELETE`) require an `If-Match` header containing the current
  `ETag`. Response headers policies, public keys, and key groups distinguish a missing header
  (`InvalidIfMatchVersion`, 400) from a stale `ETag` (`PreconditionFailed`, 412). Other CloudFront
  resources currently return `InvalidIfMatchVersion` (400) for either case.
- All `GET` and `POST` (create) responses include an `ETag` response header.
- List operations emit the payload root declared by the CloudFront REST XML model (for example,
  `ListDistributions` returns `<DistributionList>`), with list contents represented by
  `<Quantity>N</Quantity><Items>...</Items>`.
- OAI `CallerReference` uniqueness is enforced — duplicate `CallerReference` values return `CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityAlreadyExists` (409).
- CNAME aliases are globally unique. `AssociateAlias` atomically transfers an alias from its current
  owner to the target distribution. Exact aliases take precedence over the most-specific matching
  wildcard alias.
- Viewer requests addressed to an enabled distribution's generated domain or alias are routed to the
  matching S3 or custom origin when the matched cache behavior's `AllowedMethods` includes the
  method; any other method returns 403 `Invalid method.`. A behavior without `AllowedMethods` allows
  GET and HEAD. Origin forwarding preserves the raw path; custom-origin redirects are not followed.
- POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE are forwarded to custom origins with the viewer request body and its
  `Content-Type`; `Content-Length` is set from the body. Their responses are never cached, as on AWS.
  Signed URL and signed cookie enforcement applies to them like any other method. Request bodies are
  bounded by the emulator-wide `floci.protocols.max-request-size` limit.
- Every distribution is also served as `{id}.cloudfront.{host}` for each endpoint host Floci
  resolves: `localhost`, `localhost.floci.io`, `localhost.localstack.cloud`, `FLOCI_HOSTNAME` and
  every `FLOCI_DNS_EXTRA_SUFFIXES` entry. `{id}.cloudfront.localhost.floci.io` and
  `{id}.cloudfront.localhost` reach loopback with no host-file edit and are covered by the generated
  HTTPS certificate, so a signed URL for either can be downloaded over `https://`. See
  [Downloading over HTTPS](#downloading-over-https).
- Origin custom headers are persisted through the CloudFront API and CloudFormation. They replace
  every same-named forwarded viewer header on custom-origin requests. For in-process S3 origins, a
  configured `Origin` header is used for S3 CORS evaluation. AWS-prohibited names, malformed
  values, inconsistent quantities, duplicates, and quota violations are rejected with modeled
  CloudFront errors when the distribution is created or updated.
- Cache behaviors with enabled `TrustedKeyGroups` require a valid CloudFront signed URL or signed
  cookie before the origin is contacted. Signed URL parameters take precedence over signed cookies.
  Canned and custom policies support SHA-1 or SHA-256 signatures with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 public
  keys. Custom policies enforce resource wildcards, expiration, optional activation time, and
  IPv4 CIDR restrictions. Canned resources compare literally, including query strings. Exact custom
  resources can include one raw query delimiter. As a conservative limitation, other custom
  resources containing a raw `?` fail closed because the character is ambiguous with CloudFront's
  one-character wildcard; custom query-string wildcards are therefore not supported. Invalid or
  expired signatures return 403.
- A key group must contain one to five existing public keys. Public keys that belong to a key group
  and key groups referenced by a cache behavior cannot be deleted until those references are removed.
- Application query parameters are retained when constructing the resource covered by a signature.
  CloudFront signing parameters are excluded from that resource and are never sent to the origin.
- S3-origin reads honor anonymous access, OAI bucket-policy or object-ACL grants, and OAC
  service-principal bucket-policy grants (including the distribution `AWS:SourceArn`) when strict S3
  authentication is enabled. OAC `always`, `never`, and unsigned `no-override` requests follow their
  documented signing behavior; signed `no-override` viewer requests retain their authorization.
- Requests to custom origins carry what the matched cache behavior forwards. With a cache policy,
  the viewer headers, cookies and query strings selected by the cache policy's
  `ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin` and by the origin request policy are forwarded (the
  union of both). `HeaderBehavior` `none`, `whitelist`, `allViewer`,
  `allViewerAndWhitelistCloudFront` and `allExcept`, `CookieBehavior` and `QueryStringBehavior`
  `none`, `whitelist`, `allExcept` and `all` are evaluated. A cache policy that selects nothing and no
  origin request policy forwards no viewer headers, cookies or query strings, as on AWS.
- A cache behavior without a cache policy uses its legacy `ForwardedValues`: `QueryString=true`
  forwards every query string (`QueryStringCacheKeys` only narrows the cache key), cookies follow
  `Forward` `none`, `whitelist` (with `*` and `?` wildcards) or `all`, and viewer headers are
  forwarded by default except `Accept`, `Accept-Charset`, `Accept-Language`, `Authorization`,
  `Host`, `Referer`, `User-Agent` and `X-HTTP-Method-Override`, which `Headers` can add back (`*`
  forwards all of them). An origin request policy needs a cache policy on AWS, so a behavior without
  one ignores it.
- Whatever the policies, CloudFront sets `Host` to the origin's domain name unless the viewer's
  `Host` is forwarded, sends `User-Agent: Amazon CloudFront` unless the viewer's `User-Agent` is
  forwarded, appends the viewer address to `X-Forwarded-For`, adds a
  `Via: <viewer HTTP version> <distribution domain> (CloudFront)` hop and an `X-Amz-Cf-Id`.
  `Authorization` is always forwarded on POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, and on OPTIONS unless OPTIONS
  is a cached method; `Content-Type` travels with a request body. Cache policy compression settings
  normalize `Accept-Encoding` to `br,gzip`, `gzip`, `br` or `identity`. Forwarded cookies are sorted
  by name, and cookies that are not `name=value` or whose name starts with `$` are dropped.
  Hop-by-hop headers, `Expect`, `X-Edge-*`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` and viewer-supplied
  `CloudFront-*` headers are never forwarded.
- Of the CloudFront request headers, `CloudFront-Forwarded-Proto`, `CloudFront-Viewer-Address` and
  `CloudFront-Viewer-Http-Version` are generated when a policy names them, or when an `allExcept`
  header behavior does not exclude them (AWS documents Managed-AllViewerExceptHostHeader as adding
  them). Device-type, geolocation, TLS, JA3/JA4 and header-order headers are not generated.
- The eight AWS managed origin request policies are available by their AWS IDs through
  `GetOriginRequestPolicy` and `ListOriginRequestPolicies` (`Type` is `managed` or `custom`), and
  cannot be updated or deleted. AWS managed cache policies are not modeled: a behavior that
  references one forwards nothing on its account, which matches `CachingDisabled`,
  `CachingOptimized` and `CachingOptimizedForUncompressedObjects` but not `Amplify`,
  `Elemental-MediaPackage` or the `UseOriginCacheControlHeaders` policies.
- In-process S3 origins do not apply forwarding settings: viewer query strings, cookies and headers
  do not change the S3 read.
- Origin `Set-Cookie` headers always reach the viewer. With legacy `Forward=none`, AWS strips them
  from the response; Floci does not.
- Custom origins that resolve to loopback, private, link-local, carrier-grade NAT, or other non-routable addresses are rejected by default. Development-only private origins must be explicitly allowlisted by exact hostname.
- Response headers policies validate the AWS configuration shape and are applied after the origin
  response, including CORS preflight fields, origin override behavior, custom headers, security
  headers, allowed header removals, and sampled `Server-Timing` metrics. `Pragma: server-timing`
  forces those metrics for enabled policies. Distribution writes reject unknown policy IDs, and
  policies attached to a cache behavior cannot be deleted.
- Up to 20 custom response headers policies can be created, and one policy can be associated with
  up to 100 distributions.
- The five AWS managed response headers policy IDs are available and can be selected with
  `ListResponseHeadersPolicies?Type=managed`; `Type` uses the AWS lowercase `managed` or `custom`
  values.

## Downloading over HTTPS

A distribution's own domain name (`{id}.cloudfront.net` by default) resolves to nothing local, so
address the distribution by one of its local delivery hostnames instead. `*.cloudfront.localhost.floci.io`
resolves to `127.0.0.1` through public DNS and works on Linux, macOS and in containers.
`*.cloudfront.localhost` needs no DNS at all but only resolves where the runtime handles `.localhost`
itself, which macOS and browsers do and Debian-based images do not.

Start Floci with [TLS](../configuration/tls.md) enabled and trust its CA once:

```bash
docker run -e FLOCI_TLS_ENABLED=true -p 4566:4566 floci/floci:latest
curl -s http://localhost:4566/_floci/ca.pem -o floci-root-ca.pem
```

Sign the URL of the hostname you download from — the port is part of what a canned policy signs —
and fetch it:

```bash
HOST=e1z2x3c4v5b6n7.cloudfront.localhost.floci.io:4566

SIGNED=$(aws cloudfront sign \
  --url "https://$HOST/hello.txt" \
  --key-pair-id K2JCJMDEHXQW5F \
  --private-key file://private_key.pem \
  --date-less-than 2026-12-31T00:00:00Z)

curl --cacert floci-root-ca.pem "$SIGNED"
```

To drop the `:4566`, publish the HTTPS port Floci also binds when TLS is on (`-p 443:443`, see
`FLOCI_TLS_AWS_HTTPS_PORT`) and sign `https://e1z2x3c4v5b6n7.cloudfront.localhost.floci.io/hello.txt`.

Set `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN_SUFFIX=cloudfront.localhost.floci.io` to have
`CreateDistribution` return that hostname as the `DomainName`, so test code can sign the API response
as it is.

## Not Supported (Phase 2)

- Continuous deployment policies (`CreateContinuousDeploymentPolicy`, etc.)
- `CopyDistribution` (staging distributions)
- Real-time log configs (`CreateRealtimeLogConfig`, etc.)
- Field-level encryption (`CreateFieldLevelEncryptionConfig`, etc.)
- `TestFunction` execution (function is stored, not executed)
- Streaming distributions (RTMP — deprecated by AWS)
- VPC origins, Anycast IP lists, key value stores
- Monitoring subscriptions
- CloudFormation provisioning of custom `AWS::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicy` resources
  (literal custom or managed policy IDs are supported on distributions)
- Persistent edge caching and global CDN propagation
- Forwarding POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE to S3 origins. AWS passes them to S3, which evaluates them
  against the bucket policy (OAC supports `PUT` and `DELETE`); Floci's in-process S3 origin answers
  them with 403 `Access Denied`, as S3 does for a request that holds no write grant.
