`UpdateStateMachine` returns the new revision ID and update timestamp. CloudFormation updates
definition, role, logging, tracing, encryption, and tags without replacing the state machine;
changes to `StateMachineName` or `StateMachineType` use replacement semantics.

## Execution history events

`GetExecutionHistory` emits an event family around a Task state's `TaskStateEntered` and
`TaskStateExited` pair. Which family depends on the resource type.

- A service integration ARN (`arn:aws:states:::...`) emits `TaskScheduled`, `TaskStarted`,
  and then `TaskSucceeded` or `TaskFailed`. `taskScheduledEventDetails` carries
  `resourceType`, `resource`, `region`, and `parameters`. `parameters` is the resolved
  `Parameters` or `Arguments` payload, serialized as a JSON string. `timeoutInSeconds` and
  `heartbeatInSeconds` appear only when the state sets `TimeoutSeconds` or
  `HeartbeatSeconds` as a literal number.
- A direct Lambda function ARN emits `LambdaFunctionScheduled`, `LambdaFunctionStarted`,
  and then `LambdaFunctionSucceeded` or `LambdaFunctionFailed`. `LambdaFunctionScheduled`
  carries `resource` and `input`. `resource` holds the full function ARN. `LambdaFunctionStarted`
  carries no details at all. This matches AWS.
- An activity ARN emits the equivalent `Activity*` family.

A `Retry` re-entry emits its own Scheduled, Started, and Failed triple for each attempt. A
mocked Task (`SFN_MOCK_CONFIG`) emits the same events as a real one, because Step Functions
Local does the same.

Every event's `previousEventId` points to the id of the event right before it on the same
chain of states. The one exception is the first state's `*StateEntered` event. Its
`previousEventId` is `0`. That matches `ExecutionStarted`, which is always
`id: 1, previousEventId: 0`.

### Parallel branches and Map iterations

The states inside a `Parallel` branch or an inline `Map` iteration publish their events into
the parent execution's history, as on AWS. A `Parallel` records `ParallelStateStarted`,
`ParallelStateSucceeded` and `ParallelStateFailed`. An inline `Map` records `MapStateStarted`,
`MapIterationStarted`, `MapIterationSucceeded`, `MapIterationFailed`, `MapStateSucceeded` and
`MapStateFailed`. A Distributed `Map` records `MapRunStarted`, `MapRunSucceeded` and
`MapRunFailed` instead. Its items are child executions and publish nothing into the parent
history. A `Task` whose failure ends its branch also records `TaskStateAborted`.

Branches and iterations run concurrently, so the order in which their events interleave differs
from run to run. Each branch chains its own events through `previousEventId`, and that chain is
the same every time.

### The cause of a failure

The `cause` of a failure the interpreter raises starts with
`An error occurred while executing the state '<name>' (entered at the event id #<n>). `, as on
AWS. The prefix is added once, at the innermost state. A `Fail` state's `Cause` and a cause a
task's resource answered with pass through unchanged. A `Choice` that matches no rule and has
no `Default`, and a payload template path that matches nothing, fail with `States.Runtime`.
A JSONata expression that fails also records an `EvaluationFailed` event with `error`, `cause`,
`location` and `state`, once per attempt.

`inputDetails` appears on `ExecutionStarted`, on `stateEnteredEventDetails`, and on
`LambdaFunctionScheduled`/`ActivityScheduled`. `outputDetails` appears on
`stateExitedEventDetails`, on `executionSucceededEventDetails`, and on
`taskSucceededEventDetails`/`lambdaFunctionSucceededEventDetails`. Both are always
`{"truncated": false}`. Floci never truncates a payload, so the value never changes.
When the request sets `includeExecutionData` to false, the details objects stay but lose
`input`, `inputDetails`, `output`, and `outputDetails`. Every other field stays, including
`taskScheduledEventDetails.parameters`. This matches AWS.

A few gaps remain. `TaskStarted`, `LambdaFunctionStarted`, and `ActivityStarted` fire at
scheduling time, not when a worker actually picks up the task. `TaskSubmitted`, which real
AWS emits for `.sync` and `.waitForTaskToken` integrations, is not emitted yet. When a
branch fails, AWS records `*StateAborted` and `MapIterationAborted` events for the states its
sibling branches were in; Floci cancels the siblings without recording them. A Distributed
`Map` whose item fails reports the item's own error rather than AWS's
`States.ExceedToleratedFailureThreshold`, and emits `MapRunFailed` with that error.

## Map concurrency

Map states honor `MaxConcurrency` and, for JSONPath state machines, `MaxConcurrencyPath`.
JSONata state machines may supply `MaxConcurrency` as an expression. A value of `0`, or an
omitted value, uses the AWS service ceiling: 40 concurrent iterations for Inline Map states and
10,000 for Distributed Map states. `MaxConcurrency: 1` runs iterations sequentially.

Results remain in input order even when iterations finish out of order. If an iteration fails,
the Map state fails promptly, cancels its active sibling iterations, and does not start queued
iterations.

## Retry policies

`Task`, `Parallel`, and `Map` states honor their `Retry` field. `ErrorEquals` matching
follows AWS semantics, including the `States.ALL` and `States.TaskFailed` wildcards.
`States.Runtime` is never retried. AWS defaults apply when fields are omitted
(`MaxAttempts` 3, `IntervalSeconds` 1, `BackoffRate` 2.0), `MaxDelaySeconds` is honored,
and each retrier keeps its own attempt counter. `Retry` is evaluated before `Catch`, and
`$$.State.RetryCount` increments per attempt. Attempt counts, defaults, and backoff
timing were verified against real AWS Step Functions.

A state with no `Retry` array runs exactly once. This is what makes CDK-generated provider-framework
workflows converge: the `framework-isComplete-task` throws on every not-yet-complete poll and relies on
`Retry` to poll again until the custom resource reports done — see
[CloudFormation custom resources](cloudformation.md#custom-resources-and-the-cdk-provider-framework).

`JitterStrategy` supports `NONE` (the default) and `FULL`. `FULL` draws the delay
uniformly between zero and the computed delay, as on AWS. One deviation. The delay
between attempts is capped at 30 seconds, the same cap Floci applies to `Wait` states,
so emulated runs stay fast.

## Timeouts

ASL carries two `TimeoutSeconds` fields and Floci enforces both, in the two terminal shapes
AWS uses. The state machine's own field bounds every state; a `Task`'s own field only bounds
one that waits for a task token — an activity, or a `.waitForTaskToken` integration. A Lambda
or other SDK task that returns directly is not bound by it.

The state machine's own `TimeoutSeconds` is the whole execution's budget. It is checked before
every state and inside a `Wait`, so a `Wait` longer than what is left is cut rather than slept
out. The execution ends `TIMED_OUT` with `stopDate` set and no `error` and no `cause` at all;
`States.Timeout` is named only in the single `ExecutionTimedOut` event, whose `previousEventId`
is `0`. The state that was cut gets no `*StateExited` event. A `Parallel` or `Map` branch runs
on its own thread and is not cut mid-state: the budget is enforced again as soon as the branch
returns.

A `Task` that waits for a task token — an activity, or a `.waitForTaskToken` integration — has
two independent bounds. `TimeoutSeconds` is the whole wait; `HeartbeatSeconds` is the longest gap
allowed between two `SendTaskHeartbeat` calls, and every heartbeat pushes that gap forward, so a
worker that reports as often as the definition asks runs until `TimeoutSeconds` runs out. Either
clock ends the state the same way: an `ActivityTimedOut` event — `TaskTimedOut` for a
`.waitForTaskToken` integration — carrying `States.Timeout` and no cause, then an execution that
reads `FAILED` with that same error. A `Catch` on a heartbeat expiry matches under
`States.HeartbeatTimeout` and under `States.Timeout` alike. Neither timeout carries a cause:
`DescribeExecution` and the `ExecutionFailed` event both leave the key out, where every other
failure reports one. A `Task` that declares no `TimeoutSeconds` waits 300 seconds, where AWS
waits a year.

One deviation. AWS starts the `TimeoutSeconds` clock when a worker picks the task up, the instant
it emits `ActivityStarted`. Floci emits `ActivityStarted` at schedule time, so both clocks start
when the task is scheduled.

## Intrinsic arguments

A `$.` reference passed to a `States.*` intrinsic must find something. An argument that matches
nothing fails the execution with `States.Runtime`, as on AWS.

One deviation. Indexing something that is not an array makes AWS leak its JSONPath library and
write `Filter: [0] can only be applied to arrays. Current context is: 1`. Floci writes its own
`The JsonPath argument for the field '$.other[0]' could not be found in the input ...` there.

## JSONata nulls

An expression that evaluates to JSON `null` produces a value, not a missing one. It keeps its key
in `Output`, in `Assign` and in a Task's `Arguments`, at any nesting depth, and it stays in place as
an array element:

```
"Output": {"v": "{% $states.input.bar %}"}   on input {"bar": null}   ->   {"v": null}
```

The same `null` is a value inside the expression too: `$exists()` on it is true and `$type()` on it
is `"null"`.

One deviation. `$count()` on a JSON null answers `0`; AWS answers `1`.

## An expression that returns nothing fails the state

An expression that returns nothing, which is what `$states.input.absent` and the functions listed
below that evaluate to undefined do, is not a missing value the state carries on without. It fails
the state with `States.QueryEvaluationError`, naming the field it was written in, and a `Catch` on
that error fires:

```
"Output": {"v": "{% $states.input.absent %}"}
  ->  States.QueryEvaluationError
      The JSONata expression '$states.input.absent' specified for the field 'Output/v'
      returned nothing (undefined).
```

The field is named relative to the state, with `/` before each object key and `[i]` for each array
index: `Output`, `Output/a/b[0]`, `Assign/x`, `Arguments/MessageGroupId`, `Choices[1]/Condition`,
`Seconds`, `Error`, `Cause`, `Items`, `MaxConcurrency`. A matched `Choice` rule and a matching
`Catch` clause carry their own `Assign` and `Output`, which are named under the rule or clause:
`Choices[1]/Output/v`, `Choices[0]/Assign/x`, `Catch[1]/Output/v`. A `Choice` stops at the first rule
that matches, so an undefined condition in a later rule is never evaluated.

The cause of a real execution carries the state prefix described under
[The cause of a failure](#the-cause-of-a-failure).

## JSONata functions

State machines with `"QueryLanguage": "JSONata"` reach the six functions Step Functions adds on
top of the JSONata language, alongside every function JSONata itself provides.

| Function | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `$parse(jsonString)` | the deserialized value; the replacement for `$eval`, which AWS disables and so does Floci, answering `T1006` to a call |
| `$partition(array, chunkSize)` | `array` split into chunks of `chunkSize`, the last one holding the remainder |
| `$range(start, end, step)` | the values from `start` to `end`, inclusive when `step` lands on `end` |
| `$hash(str, algorithm)` | the hex digest of `str`; `algorithm` is `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384` or `SHA-512`, case-sensitive |
| `$random(seed)` | a number in `[0, 1)`, reproducible under the optional integer `seed` |
| `$uuid()` | a v4 UUID |

Three behaviours are worth knowing before reading an unexpected result, and all three are AWS's:

- A non-integer argument is rounded **towards zero**, so `$range(-1.7, 2, 1)` starts at `-1` and
  `$partition(items, 2.9)` chunks by 2.
- Several arguments evaluate to undefined rather than failing: a chunk size of zero, an empty
  array, a `$range` with no `step` or with a step whose sign disagrees with the direction, and a
  `$hash` with no algorithm. The argument itself does not fail; the field the expression was
  written in does, under `States.QueryEvaluationError`, as the section above records.
- `$range` collapses a single-element range to the bare number, not a one-element array.

JSONata's own `$string` follows AWS's number notation: a whole number is written out in full below
`1e21` and in exponent notation from there, on both signs, so `$string(1e20)` is
`100000000000000000000` and `$string(1e21)` is `1e+21`.

The execution input reaching `$states.input` follows the same number model as `$parse`: an integer
stays exact while it fits in a `long` and switches to a `double` past that boundary, matching AWS.

JSONata's own `$formatNumber` checks its picture string against the fourteen rules of XPath F&O
4.7.3, as AWS does, so `$formatNumber(1, "x")` fails with `D3086` rather than answering `x1`: a
picture with no digit in it describes no number.

Evaluation is bounded on three axes, as it is on AWS, and past any of them the state fails with
`States.QueryEvaluationError`.

- **Depth**: one expression may nest 100 levels, which is AWS's own ceiling: AWS accepts `1+1+…+1`
  at 100 terms, 99 parentheses, 99 brackets, 99 `~>` stages, and a non-tail-recursive `$f(31)`,
  which nests `3n+5`, and refuses one level more of each. The refusal names the depth reached, as
  in `Stack overflow error: … Depth=101 max=100`.
- **Memory**: one value an expression builds may hold 6,990,256 bytes, counting a number as eight
  bytes and a character as one. That is AWS's own bound: AWS accepts `[1..873782]` and refuses one
  element more, and it accepts a string doubled 22 times, 2^22 characters, refusing the 23rd. The
  refusal is AWS's own
  `Expression evaluation memory limit exceeded`, which is what `[1..900000] ~> $count()` and
  `$sum([1..900000])` now answer. `$range` holds a tighter bound of its own, checked before it
  allocates rather than on the array it would have built: AWS accepts `$range(1, 360145, 1)`, all
  360,145 elements, and refuses one element more with the same refusal. A lazy literal range such
  as `[1..873782]` is exempt from both bounds on AWS, and stays exempt here.
- **Time**: five seconds, which is the library's own default and roughly fifty times the slowest
  evaluation of a payload AWS itself accepts. A recursive expression with no base case is a tail
  call, so it loops rather than nesting and only the clock ends it.

JSON has no literal for a non-finite number, so AWS writes each one as the string JavaScript names
it by, wherever it lands: `1/0` is `"Infinity"`, `1e308 * 10` is `"Infinity"`, `0/0` is `"NaN"` and
`$parseInteger("abc", "0")` is `"NaN"`, and nested, `[1/0]` is `["Infinity"]` and `{"k": 1/0}` is
`{"k": "Infinity"}`.

One deviation, on the arithmetic half of that. A non-finite number a **function** answers is a value
like any other here, so `$parseInteger("abc", "0")` is `"NaN"` on its own, inside an array and
inside an object, as on AWS. One the **arithmetic** produces is not: the JSONata library refuses to
carry it and raises instead, so Floci sees the value only in that refusal, after it has unwound
whatever was being built around it. `1/0`, `-1/0` and `1e308 * 10` are answered because the
expression's own result is what was refused; `[1/0]`, `{"k": 1/0}` and `$string(1/0)` fail the state
with `States.QueryEvaluationError` where AWS answers a string, and `0/0` fails the field that holds
it, because NaN is dropped as not-a-number without even a refusal to read it from. A state that
fails is one a `Catch` fires on, which is the half of the divergence worth keeping.

## Execution names

A Standard execution name is unique per account, Region and state machine. Starting a Standard
execution with a name and input that match one still running returns that original execution, so a
retried call is idempotent; any other reuse of the name, whether a different input or a name whose
execution has already closed, fails with `ExecutionAlreadyExists`.

One deviation. AWS frees a Standard name 90 days after the execution closes; Floci keeps it taken for
the life of the emulator, so a closed name never becomes reusable on its own.

An Express execution name is not unique. Every `StartExecution` on an Express state machine is its
own execution that runs alongside any others of the same name, and its ARN carries a per-start id
after the name (`express:<stateMachine>:<name>:<id>`). Reusing an Express name never returns an
earlier execution and never fails with `ExecutionAlreadyExists`.

One more. AWS keeps no record of an Express execution once it ends, only its logs, and does not serve
`DescribeExecution`, `GetExecutionHistory` or `ListExecutions` for one. Floci keeps every Express
execution, running or finished, in its execution store (and, in persistent mode, in
`sfn-executions.json`), and nothing evicts them while the emulator runs. A workload that
starts the same Express name in a tight loop therefore grows that store without bound.

## Nested workflows

A parent workflow calls a child workflow through one of several integrations, and they differ in
more than syntax:

| Resource | Child type | A child that fails | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution` | Standard | not awaited | `{executionArn, startDate}` |
| `arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution.sync` | Standard | fails the calling task | execution envelope, `output` as a JSON string |
| `arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution.sync:2` | Standard | fails the calling task | the child output, parsed |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:startExecution` | Standard | not awaited | `{ExecutionArn, StartDate}` |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:startSyncExecution` | Express | reported through `Status` | PascalCase envelope, `Output` as a JSON string |

`states:startExecution` and `aws-sdk:sfn:startExecution` are the same API through two different
integrations, and only the casing of the result tells them apart.

`startSyncExecution` is the only one that does not fail the calling task when the child fails: the
SDK call itself succeeded, so the task result carries `Status`, `Error` and `Cause` and the parent
decides what to do next.

A `Name` a Standard child already used fails the calling task with the child's collision error, named
for the integration that raised it: `StepFunctions.ExecutionAlreadyExistsException` through
`states:startExecution` in any of its modes, and `Sfn.ExecutionAlreadyExistsException` through
`aws-sdk:sfn:startExecution`. An Express child starts a new execution instead, so the same `Name`
never fails it.

## AWS SDK task integrations

A resource of the form `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:<service>:<action>` calls the service's API and
returns its response. Two conventions separate that result from the same API's wire response, and
both are AWS's:

- **Field names are the SDK's**, so a `startDate` on the wire is a `StartDate` in the task result.
- **A timestamp is an ISO-8601 string** such as `2026-08-28T20:34:59.712Z`, where the wire response
  carries epoch seconds.

A failure names the SDK exception class, which always ends in `Exception`:
`StartExecution` answers a missing state machine with the error code `StateMachineDoesNotExist` on
the wire and the task fails with `Sfn.StateMachineDoesNotExistException`.

| Resource | Result | Notable failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:startExecution` | `{ExecutionArn, StartDate}` | `Sfn.ExecutionAlreadyExistsException` when `Name` is reused on a Standard child |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:startSyncExecution` | execution envelope | `Sfn.StateMachineTypeNotSupportedException` for a Standard child |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:sendTaskSuccess` | `{}` | `Sfn.InvalidTokenException` when no task is waiting on the token |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:sendTaskFailure` | `{}` | `Sfn.InvalidTokenException` |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:scheduler:createSchedule` | `{ScheduleArn}` | `Scheduler.ConflictException` when the name is taken |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:scheduler:updateSchedule` | `{ScheduleArn}` | `Scheduler.ResourceNotFoundException` |
| `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sns:publish` | `{MessageId}` | `Sns.NotFoundException` when the topic does not exist |

`sendTaskSuccess` and `sendTaskFailure` resolve a token a `.waitForTaskToken` task is parked on. A
token nobody is waiting for fails the calling task rather than reporting a delivery that never
happened.

## Publishing to SNS

`arn:aws:states:::sns:publish` calls the SNS Publish API with the task's parameters and returns the
Publish response, `{MessageId}`. `TopicArn`, `TargetArn`, `PhoneNumber`, `Message`, `Subject`,
`MessageStructure`, `MessageAttributes`, `MessageGroupId` and `MessageDeduplicationId` are the API's
own fields, so a FIFO topic needs a `MessageGroupId` here just as it does from the SDK. A `Message`
given as an object rather than a string is published as its JSON text, which is how a
`.waitForTaskToken` task hands its token to the subscriber:

```json
{
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::sns:publish.waitForTaskToken",
  "Parameters": {
    "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:000000000000:myTopic",
    "Message": {
      "Input.$": "$.message",
      "TaskToken.$": "$$.Task.Token"
    }
  },
  "End": true
}
```

A failure names the SDK exception class under the `SNS.` prefix, so a topic that does not exist
fails the task with `SNS.NotFoundException` and a missing `Message` with
`SNS.InvalidParameterException`. `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sns:publish` is the same call under the
`Sns.` prefix, as the AWS SDK integration table above shows.

## Publishing events

`arn:aws:states:::events:putEvents` returns the PutEvents response itself, `Entries` and
`FailedEntryCount`, and one rejected entry fails the whole task with `EventBridge.FailedEntry`. The
cause is the response serialized as a string, so a `Catch` can read which entry was rejected:

```json
{"FailedEntryCount":1,"Entries":[{"EventId":"08cbdc46-…"},{"ErrorCode":"InvalidArgument","ErrorMessage":"EventBus not found: no-such-bus"}]}
```

One deviation, and it belongs to EventBridge rather than to the integration: Floci rejects an entry
addressed to an event bus that does not exist, while AWS accepts it and returns an `EventId`.

## JSONata expressions are validated when the state machine is created

A JSONata expression runs with no context item: the execution input arrives as `$states.input`
and a variable written by `Assign` as `$name`. A path that starts from neither reads a context
item that does not exist, and AWS refuses the whole definition:

```
An error occurred (InvalidDefinition) when calling the CreateStateMachine operation:
Invalid State Machine Definition: 'UNSUPPORTED_JSONATA_EXPRESSION: Reference to 'phone' at the
top level is not supported. at /States/E/Output/v'
```

Floci refuses it too, from `CreateStateMachine`, `UpdateStateMachine` and
`ValidateStateMachineDefinition`, with that message and that location. Write
`$states.input.phone` to read the input and `$phone` to read a variable: an earlier `Assign` of
`phone` does not put a bare `phone` in scope on AWS either.

Only the first step of a path is read against the top-level context, so a name in a later step,
in a predicate, in a sort term or in an object grouping stays legal and
`$states.input.items[value > 3]` is accepted. A lambda body keeps the context of the expression
that defines it, so `$map($states.input.a, function($x){ b })` does name `b` at the top level.

A JSONata expression that fails to parse, such as `{% a[1,2) %}`, is refused the same way, with
`INVALID_JSONATA_EXPRESSION` and the parser's own message at the field's location. `$$`, the
reference to the top-level context, is refused under `UNSUPPORTED_JSONATA_EXPRESSION` with the
message `Reference to '$$' is not supported.`; so is `$states.errorOutput` outside the one place it
resolves, a catcher's own `Output` or `Assign`.

A definition is refused outright, with no state machine created, for a graph that never reaches a
terminal state (`MISSING_END_STATE`), for a `StartAt`, `Next`, `Default` or `Catch[].Next` naming a
state absent from its container or a state nothing transitions to (`MISSING_TRANSITION_TARGET`),
and for a field the state type does not carry: `TimeoutSeconds` only on `Task`, and `Catch`/`Retry`
only on `Task`, `Parallel` and `Map`.

## A state's QueryLanguage, and the fields it may carry

A state's query language is JSONPath when its `QueryLanguage` field is exactly the string
`"JSONPath"`, the state machine's when the field is absent, and JSONata for any other value: the
wrong case, an unknown string and a non-string alike. A state inside a `Map`'s `ItemProcessor` or `Iterator`, or
inside one of a `Parallel`'s `Branches`, falls back to the **state machine's** language and not to
the enclosing `Map`'s or `Parallel`'s, which the Amazon States Language calls independent of it. The
enclosing state's own fields, `Items` and `MaxConcurrency` among them, do use its own language.

Three more refusals, each measured against `ValidateStateMachineDefinition` on real AWS:

- A field that belongs to the other query language, at the state's path with no field suffix:
  `The QueryLanguage is set to 'JSONPath', but field 'Output' is only supported for the 'JSONata'
  QueryLanguage`, and the mirror of it for `InputPath`, `OutputPath`, `ResultPath`,
  `ResultSelector`, `Parameters`, `Result`, `ItemsPath` and `MaxConcurrencyPath` on a JSONata
  state. `Assign` belongs to neither list: AWS accepts it on both.
- A state declaring `"QueryLanguage": "JSONPath"` under a `JSONata` state machine:
  `'QueryLanguage' can not be 'JSONPath' if set to 'JSONata' for whole state machine`, again at the
  state's path. A JSONata machine cannot be reverted one state at a time; the upgrade in the other
  direction is allowed. That diagnostic is the whole answer for that state, so the fields its
  refused language forbids are not reported on top of it, while every other check still runs.
- `QueryLanguage` on the `ItemProcessor`, `Iterator` or branch object itself, which is not a state:
  `Field 'QueryLanguage' is not supported` at `/States/M/ItemProcessor`.

A `QueryLanguage` value outside the enum is reported at the field, `/States/X/QueryLanguage` or
`/QueryLanguage`, with `Value should be one of the following: [JSONPath, JSONata]`, and a
non-string value with `Expected value of type [STRING]`. That diagnostic is independent of the
resolution above, so `"jsonpath"` is a JSONata state that also carries it, and it is not a
downgrade: only the exact string `"JSONPath"` under a JSONata machine is.

Locations follow AWS: the two messages above point at the state, `/States/X`, while every other
schema error points at the offending field, `/States/X/MaxConcurrency`.

## Mocked service integrations

Floci supports the Step Functions Local mock configuration format
(`MockConfigFile.json`). This lets a Task state return a predefined result or error
instead of calling the integrated service. It is the standard way to unit test `Catch`
and `Retry` branches, and it also lets you execute state machines whose integrations
Floci does not implement yet.

Point `SFN_MOCK_CONFIG` at the mock configuration file and start an execution against
`<stateMachineArn>#<testCaseName>`:

```bash
# docker run -e SFN_MOCK_CONFIG=/tmp/mock.json -v ./MockConfigFile.json:/tmp/mock.json ...
aws stepfunctions start-execution \
  --state-machine-arn "$SM_ARN#Throw422" \
  --input '{}' \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

```json
{
  "StateMachines": {
    "Test": { "TestCases": { "Throw422": { "Call API": "ApiFailure" } } }
  },
  "MockedResponses": {
    "ApiFailure": {
      "0": { "Throw": { "Error": "ApiGateway.422", "Cause": "Unprocessable" } }
    },

      "0-1": { "Return": { "StatusCode": 200, "ResponseBody": { "id": 1 } } }

```

Each test case maps a state name to a `MockedResponses` entry. Each mocked response is
keyed by retry attempt (`"0"`, `"1"`, or a range like `"1-2"`), so a state can fail on
the first attempt and succeed on a retry. `Return` supplies the task result. `Throw`
fails the task with the given `Error` and `Cause`, which flow through `Retry` and
`Catch` unchanged. States not named in the test case run their real integration, so
mocked and real service calls can be combined in one execution. The file is re-read
when it changes, so it can be edited without restarting Floci.

Behavior was verified against Step Functions Local 2.0.0. As there, `StartSyncExecution`
rejects a test case suffix with `UnsupportedOperation` and does not strip a bare trailing
`#`, a bare trailing `#` on `StartExecution` runs the execution unmocked, and a retry
attempt with no mocked entry fails the execution with `States.Runtime`. One intentional deviation: Floci reports an unknown test case and any
invalid mock configuration (unparseable file, bad attempt key, missing `MockedResponses`
entry, `Return` and `Throw` together, `Throw` without `Error`) as a structured 400 error
at `StartExecution`. Step Functions Local instead returns a plain HTTP 500 for most of
these and starts the execution only to fail it with `States.Runtime` for the last two.

A mocked response with no attempt entries (`{}`) is not rejected. As in Step Functions
Local, the execution starts and fails with `States.Runtime` only if the state that names
it is entered. This keeps a generated mock file usable when the collection it was built
from is empty and the state is never reached.

## Executions abandoned by a restart

An execution runs in the Floci process. When Floci restarts while an execution is `RUNNING`,
no worker survives it, so at startup every execution still stored as `RUNNING` is aborted with no
error and no cause, the shape AWS returns for `StopExecution` called without them:
`DescribeExecution` reports `status` `ABORTED` and a `stopDate`, and leaves the `error` and `cause`
keys out. How many executions the sweep retired is reported once, as a `WARN` log line. Executions
of every account are swept, each written back under its own account. Executions that already
reached a terminal status are left untouched, and so is the status and `stopDate` of one this sweep
aborted on an earlier boot.

Execution history is stored with the execution. While an execution is running, the current history
is checkpointed every 100 events and when the execution reaches a terminal state. A graceful
shutdown flushes the current execution state before the emulator stops. On restart, persisted
history is retained, and a previously running execution is marked `ABORTED` with one
`ExecutionAborted` event appended. After a further restart, the execution is already terminal, so
no additional event is written.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_STEPFUNCTIONS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |
| `SFN_MOCK_CONFIG` | unset | Path to a Step Functions Local compatible mock configuration file (alias: `FLOCI_SERVICES_STEPFUNCTIONS_MOCK_CONFIG_FILE`) |
