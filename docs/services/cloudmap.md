# AWS Cloud Map

**Protocol:** JSON 1.1
**Header:** `X-Amz-Target: Route53AutoNaming_v20170314.<Action>`
**Endpoint prefix:** `servicediscovery`

Floci emulates the AWS Cloud Map (service discovery) control plane in-process:
namespaces, services, and registered instances are stored as account-aware
domain objects, and discovery queries resolve against that in-memory state.

Asynchronous operations (`CreateHttpNamespace`, `CreatePublicDnsNamespace`,
`CreatePrivateDnsNamespace`, `DeleteNamespace`, `RegisterInstance`,
`DeregisterInstance`) apply their effect synchronously and return an operation
id. The operation reaches `SUCCESS` immediately by default, so a follow-up
`GetOperation` call returns a completed operation without polling. No Route 53
hosted zones are created: public and private DNS namespaces are assigned a
synthetic `HostedZoneId` so SDK and CLI clients can exercise the full Cloud Map
control flow locally.

### DNS resolution

A DNS namespace is answerable, not just storable. Floci's embedded DNS server
resolves `<service>.<namespace>` to the `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` of the instances
registered under that service, one A record each, so a container that uses Floci
as its resolver reaches its peers by name. Instances registered directly through
`RegisterInstance` and instances an ECS service registers through its
`serviceRegistries` resolve the same way.

Which instances answer follows Route 53: the healthy ones while any instance is
healthy, and all of them when none is, so a service whose instances have all gone
unhealthy still resolves rather than disappearing from DNS. At most eight records
go back either way, as Route 53 answers a service discovery query.
Names inside a DNS namespace stay local when no instance has a usable address:
the resolver answers negatively instead of forwarding them to upstream DNS.

Three limits are worth knowing. `HTTP` namespaces do not resolve, matching AWS,
where they are reachable only through `DiscoverInstances`. Only A records are
served, so a name that AWS would answer with an `SRV` record answers with the
address alone. And the embedded DNS server only runs when Floci itself runs
inside Docker, so name resolution is available to containers, not to processes on
the host.

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| `CreateHttpNamespace` | Creates an `HTTP` namespace; returns an operation id |
| `CreatePublicDnsNamespace` | Creates a `DNS_PUBLIC` namespace with a synthetic `HostedZoneId` |
| `CreatePrivateDnsNamespace` | Creates a `DNS_PRIVATE` namespace; requires `Vpc`, assigns a `HostedZoneId` |
| `GetNamespace` | Returns a namespace by `Id` |
| `ListNamespaces` | Lists namespaces in the current region |
| `DeleteNamespace` | Deletes an empty namespace; fails with `ResourceInUse` if it still has services |
| `CreateService` | Creates a service (optionally under a namespace), tracks revision and instance count |
| `GetService` | Returns a service by `Id` |
| `ListServices` | Lists services, optionally filtered by `NamespaceId` |
| `DeleteService` | Deletes a service with no instances; fails with `ResourceInUse` otherwise |
| `RegisterInstance` | Registers an instance under a service; requires `InstanceId` and `Attributes`, bumps service revision |
| `DeregisterInstance` | Removes a registered instance and bumps service revision |
| `GetInstance` | Returns a registered instance by `ServiceId` and `InstanceId` |
| `ListInstances` | Lists instances registered under a service |
| `GetInstancesHealthStatus` | Returns health status keyed by instance id, with optional `Instances` filter |
| `DiscoverInstances` | Resolves instances by `NamespaceName` + `ServiceName`, with `HealthStatus` and `QueryParameters` filtering |
| `DiscoverInstancesRevision` | Returns the current revision for a discovered service |
| `GetOperation` | Returns an operation by `Id` |
| `ListOperations` | Lists operations with optional `STATUS`, `TYPE`, `NAMESPACE_ID`, and `SERVICE_ID` filters |
| `TagResource` | Adds tags to a namespace or service ARN |
| `UntagResource` | Removes tag keys from a namespace or service ARN |
| `ListTagsForResource` | Lists tags for a namespace or service ARN |

`DiscoverInstances` supports the `HEALTHY`, `UNHEALTHY`, `HEALTHY_OR_ELSE_ALL`,
and `ALL` health filters, and matches instances whose attributes contain every
key/value pair supplied in `QueryParameters`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDMAP_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CLOUDMAP_OPERATION_COMPLETION_DELAY_SECONDS` | `0` | Delay before an async operation transitions from `PENDING` to `SUCCESS`; `0` completes immediately |

## Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test

aws servicediscovery create-http-namespace --name floci-demo

aws servicediscovery list-namespaces

aws servicediscovery create-service \
  --name backend \
  --namespace-id ns-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

aws servicediscovery register-instance \
  --service-id srv-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --instance-id i-0123456789 \
  --attributes AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4=10.0.0.10

aws servicediscovery discover-instances \
  --namespace-name floci-demo \
  --service-name backend
```

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client(
    "servicediscovery",
    endpoint_url="http://localhost:4566",
    region_name="us-east-1",
)

ns = client.create_http_namespace(Name="floci-demo")
client.get_operation(OperationId=ns["OperationId"])  # Status == "SUCCESS"

namespace_id = client.list_namespaces()["Namespaces"][0]["Id"]
service = client.create_service(Name="backend", NamespaceId=namespace_id)

client.register_instance(
    ServiceId=service["Service"]["Id"],
    InstanceId="i-0123456789",
    Attributes={"AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4": "10.0.0.10"},
)

found = client.discover_instances(NamespaceName="floci-demo", ServiceName="backend")
print(found["Instances"])
```

## Out of Scope

- Route 53 hosted zone / record set creation.
- SRV, AAAA and CNAME records: `AWS_INSTANCE_PORT` is stored and returned, but only A records are served.
- Route 53 health checks backing `HealthCheckConfig` (custom health status is stored, not actively probed).
- `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` and `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` on `RegisterInstance`. Every instance registers `HEALTHY`, which is AWS's own initial status when `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` is absent, so only a caller that explicitly asks for `UNHEALTHY` sees a difference.
- Cross-region namespace and service discovery. A DNS query carries no region, so a name resolves through whichever namespace copy holds instances.
