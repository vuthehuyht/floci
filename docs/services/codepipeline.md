# CodePipeline

Floci implements the AWS CodePipeline JSON 1.1 API and a local pipeline execution engine.

**Protocol:** `POST /` with `Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1` and
`X-Amz-Target: CodePipeline_20150709.<Action>`.

## Supported Operations (44 total)

The complete CodePipeline 2015-07-09 API surface is routed:

- Pipeline lifecycle, state, execution history, start, stop, retry, and rollback
- Stage transitions, manual approvals, action and rule execution history
- Custom action types and AWS/third-party worker job polling
- Webhook registration and tag lifecycle

Pipeline definitions, executions, custom action types, jobs, webhooks, tags, and transition
state use Floci's configured storage backend.

## Execution

Stages execute in declaration order. Actions with the same `runOrder` execute in parallel.
`SUPERSEDED`, `QUEUED`, and `PARALLEL` execution modes are recognized, with `QUEUED` and
`PARALLEL` restricted to V2 pipelines.
A `QUEUED` or `PARALLEL` pipeline holds at most 50 active executions, as on AWS;
`StartPipelineExecution` beyond that returns `ConcurrentPipelineExecutionsLimitExceededException`.

S3 source actions poll for source changes by default, matching AWS when `PollForSourceChanges` is
omitted or set to `true`. Floci establishes a baseline for the configured object and starts one new
execution when its version ID or ETag changes, recording `PollForSourceChanges` as the execution
trigger. Set `PollForSourceChanges` to `false` to disable this polling path.

`RetryStageExecution` resumes the same pipeline execution at a failed stage. `FAILED_ACTIONS`
reruns failed or not-yet-started actions while preserving successful actions; `ALL_ACTIONS` reruns
the complete stage. Runtime artifacts from failed executions are retained for the retry until a newer
execution fails the same stage, and a successful retry continues with the stages that follow rather
than restarting from the source.
A retried execution counts toward the `QUEUED`/`PARALLEL` active-execution limit, and a second retry of
the same execution while it is still running, including while sibling actions of a failed action
finish, returns `ConflictException`.

S3 source actions resolve `sourceRevisions` from the object actually consumed by the execution.
Unversioned objects report their ETag as the revision ID; versioned objects report the version ID.
`StartPipelineExecution.sourceRevisions` is treated as an override, including supported S3 object-key
and version-ID overrides, rather than being copied directly into execution history.
Resolved revisions appear in `ListPipelineExecutions` summaries, as on AWS. `RollbackStage` reruns
with the object key and version ID the target execution consumed, so rolling back redeploys that
version rather than the latest upload.

The following providers execute against local Floci services:

| Category | Provider | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Source | S3 | Reads the configured object and publishes the output artifact |
| Build/Test | CodeBuild | Starts and monitors the configured local CodeBuild project |
| Deploy | S3 | Writes the input artifact to the configured bucket and key |
| Deploy | CodeDeploy | Starts and monitors a local CodeDeploy deployment |
| Invoke | Lambda | Invokes the configured local Lambda function |
| Invoke | CodePipeline | Starts a nested local pipeline execution |
| Approval | Manual | Waits for `PutApprovalResult` |
| Custom/third-party | Any registered action | Uses poll, acknowledge, success, and failure job APIs |

AWS-managed providers without a corresponding Floci execution adapter fail the action with an
AWS-shaped action error. Floci does not call real AWS accounts or third-party SaaS providers.

## Approvals

`PutApprovalResult` completes waiting Manual approval actions with AWS-shaped validation
and error responses. Floci validates the stage and action names, enforces `result.status`
as `Approved` or `Rejected`, limits `result.summary` to 512 characters, returns
`InvalidApprovalTokenException` for unknown tokens, and returns
`ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException` if the same approval token is reused after completion.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables the CodePipeline API |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_MODE` | global mode | Overrides CodePipeline storage mode |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | Hybrid storage flush interval |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_SOURCE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `500` | How often (ms) S3 sources are polled for a new object revision |

## Example

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 codepipeline create-pipeline \
  --pipeline file://pipeline.json

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 codepipeline start-pipeline-execution \
  --name local-release

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 codepipeline list-pipeline-executions \
